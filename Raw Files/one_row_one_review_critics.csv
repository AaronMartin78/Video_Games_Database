Pick this up if you’re a fan of the series, or especially if you never tried the original release and want the best version available.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Push Square,"Aside from some more inventive level design and a couple of new bells and whistles to keep you occupied, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is more of the same, which in our book is no bad thing. There’s little here that will surprise you, but it does just as good a job as the first game in providing a simple, grin-inducing few hours. We’ve rather enjoyed revisiting both titles this year, and we think fans old and new will still get a lot of fun out of them. Games as jovial as this one don’t come around very often these days, so if you’re after something light, you’ll have a ball.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,IGN Italia,The colorful and crazy world of LocoRoco 2 returns with an excellent remastered.,80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Meristation,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is a perfect opportunity for everyone: those who did not enjoy the title before and also those who keep a good memory and want to relive it. A game able to dazzle with his drawings and, above all, with its really great soundtrack.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,God is a Geek,"A great port of a nine year old PSP game, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is as fun as it has ever been. Colourful and downright adorable, it’s a game that everyone can (and should) play.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,GameOver.gr,"The beautiful platformer from Japan Studio hasn’t lost an ounce of its charm, and in PS4, with the enhanced resolution, it looks and feels better than ever.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,PLAY! Zine,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered brings the well deserved high resolution uplift to a timeless classic. With an unchanged essence, LocoRoco 2 is still that charming and silly platformer we fell in love with ages ago. If you’ve never played it before, yet refuse do to so now... what's wrong with you, are you loco? Bad pun - but a great game.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Eurogamer Italy,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is proof that certain games never get old. Funny as nine years later, thanks to the high definition, the game amazes even more easily.",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Playstation Official Magazine UK,"The superior game in the series. [Feb 2018, p.91]",80,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,IGN Spain,"Colorful & delightful, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is simply a great option for all players to revive one of the cutest experiences ever in platforming games. Don't miss it, if you have the chance; it's deeper than it seems.",78,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Vandal,"LocoRoco 2 still is a great game, but it doesn't offer anything you couldn't find in the original. Anyway, it's a good opportunity for new players to discover it.",78,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Impulsegamer,"Sony’s more esoteric puzzle and rhythm-based games are a bit of an acquired taste, with the pervading cheeriness and garish graphics serving as a turn off for some, but if you dig on these kind of games then LocoRoco 2 offers up a nice evolution upon the formula of the first title.",78,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Critical Hit,"As with the first game, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is an unremarkable remaster of a delightfully charming game. The game’s bright and colourful visuals pop in higher resolutions, and the music comes to life through bigger speakers than the PSP offered. It’s a pity that like other PSP remasters, the cut scenes are a blurry mess, but that’s a minor complaint.",75,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,SpazioGames,"LocoRoco 2 brings to the table a solid platform experience that resembles too closely its predecessor. However, the game is still highly recommended for all those who loved the first chapter.",75,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Trusted Reviews,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is a solid enhancement over the original release that fails to iron out all of the kinks I would have liked. The simplistic platforming and inventive level design are occasionally let down by imprecise controls, although this is far from a dealbreaker.",70,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,TheSixthAxis,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered certainly gets the job done and while it is shorter than the original, there’s a ton of side content present. Its charming, minimalist detail looks great on the whole and runs as smoothly as one could hope for. The omission to that is with the low resolution cutscenes, which is somewhat ironic considering the emphasis on 4K in the marketing, but LocoRoco 2 Remastered is more of the same, which can only be a good thing.",70,79
locoroco 2,playstation-4,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"After ten years of release, LocoRoco 2 back with colorful adventure and innovative gameplay. Though lack of game engine might be tricky to deal, this doesn't mean you can't have fun playing LocoRoco 2.",70,79
locoroco 2,psp,1UP,"The game exudes a sense of innocence and charm that quickly sweeps away any frustrations, and leaves you whistling the theme song long after you put it down.",100,85
locoroco 2,psp,Gaming Age,"Once again, the LocoRoco 2 soundtrack takes center stage for me, with some great tunes scattered about the levels that are only aided by the different noises the LocoRoco and other creatures will make that seem to run in tandem with the music at times.",100,85
locoroco 2,psp,Extreme Gamer,"LocoRoco 2 is a shining example of how the PSP can be used to grab a share in the casual market along with hardcore gamers. LocoRoco 2 has so much charm that it is near impossible to hate. LocoRoco 2 can be enjoyed in long sittings, or quickly in a one-level run.",95,85
locoroco 2,psp,Worth Playing,You'll wind up playing through levels a couple of times past the point when you've unlocked everything - without even knowing there's nothing left to figure out - and it won't be a minute wasted.,95,85
locoroco 2,psp,Game Informer,"The core game is one of the strongest platformers out there, and the mountain of extras pile on the enjoyment.",93,85
locoroco 2,psp,GamingTrend,"Simply put, if you own a PSP and do not buy this game, shame on you. You’ll be missing one of the best games of the year.",93,85
locoroco 2,psp,IGN,"It may not be nearly as deep as the first game in terms of levels, but LocoRoco 2 delivers the same kind of visual flair, solid gameplay and musical addictiveness that the first game had.",91,85
locoroco 2,psp,VideoGamer,"Some will think the game too short, the gameplay repetitive and the experience too similar to the original to warrant forking out another £20, but those people are heartless grouches who no doubt spend their time scaring children and trampling on daisies. For everyone else, LocoRoco 2 is the most uplifting game available, not only on the title-shy PSP, but on any platform.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,D+PAD Magazine,"While not as great a progression as it could have been, LocoRoco 2 still manages to squash, bounce and squeeze its way into must-have territory, and is as pristine a slice of portable gaming as one could hope for. Visually arresting, a pleasure to play and an aural triumph (we dare you not to hum along to the soundtrack!), the love and attention that has been lavished on its production veritably oozes from the screen.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,WonderwallWeb,"Even though LocoRoco 2 is a sequel, it is still one of the most original and addictive games that you will play on your PSP.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,Pocket Gamer UK,"One of the must-have PSP games of the year, LocoRoco 2 delivers everything we could have wanted - more stuff to unlock and plenty of joyful, secret-packed levels full of weirdness and wonder.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,"Few games will make you smile more vibrantly. [Jan 2009, p.70]",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),"If ""LocoRoco's"" too-cute art style turns you off or its odd gameplay still confuses you, trust me. Give LocoRoco 2 30 open-minded minutes. You won't regret it. [Mar 2009, p.74]",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,Gameplanet,No better and no worse than the original - but still an absolute joy in nearly every respect. This is a must-have title for the PSP.,90,85
locoroco 2,psp,DarkStation,"If you enjoyed the first, or are interested in getting into the series, then I would highly recommend checking this game out. Plus you can’t beat the $20 price point, that is some serious bang for your buck.",90,85

locoroco 2,psp,Gamervision,"LocoRoco 2 is a pleasure. It lacks the depth of some of its contemporaries, to be sure, but in terms of sheer enjoyment value few games come close. It’s euphoric, and there’s more than enough content and unlockables to justify the $19.99 price tag.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,GameFocus,"LocoRoco 2 is a great continuation to the series and a game that most, if not all, PSP owners should have in their collection. Other than the minor gripe with the sensitive controls, there is a lot to love about this game. If you missed the opportunity to play the first, there is no real excuse to not get LocoRoco 2. At a very affordable price-point, you’re getting more than enough to satisfy your portable gaming needs for a long time.",90,85
locoroco 2,psp,PSM3 Magazine UK,"A slightly improved, gleeful and irresistible triumph only tempered by familiarity. [Issue#174, p.76]",89,85

locoroco 2,psp,GameSpot,"Still hands-down the cutest franchise on the PSP, LocoRoco 2 adds enough new ideas to its already unique gameplay to make it a great improvement on the original game.",85,85
locoroco 2,psp,PALGN,"It's bigger, better and happier. Let a little LocoRoco love into your life and you'll never regret it.",85,85
locoroco 2,psp,Pelit (Finland),LocoRoco 2 is basicly the same game than LocoRoco 1. That is by no means a negative fact as gameplay is exceptionally clever and fun and makes you fall in love with guiding the cute little LocoRocos to the goal. A platform game with a bit of puzzle and action in between has rarely been this much fun and never as heartwarming as now. [Jan 2009],85,85
locoroco 2,psp,Destructoid,"LocoRoco 2 is a great title at a great price point. Its misgivings -- short playtime, lack of narrative substance and meaningless collectibles -- are easily trumped by the game’s character and solid gameplay.",85,85
locoroco 2,psp,Gamers' Temple,"Even if you don't normally go for cute games, LocoRoco 2 is worth checking out - even if you can only play it when no one else is watching.",85,85
locoroco 2,psp,Cheat Code Central,"The carefully crafted animations always transmit the right feel at the right time, whether you're bouncing over a spongy surface, gliding through windy areas, or sliding on ice. Everything in this game is charming; it has a cheery vibe you won't be able to find elsewhere.",84,85
locoroco 2,psp,Game Revolution,"For all the Blues Clues color palette, the flowers blowing in the breeze past dancing cacti, and a soundtrack that seems to recorded by the Alvin and the Chipmunks singing J-pop for a kindergarten show and tell on happy brownie recipes, it has the artistic polish that Sony is known for and a redesign that is nearly flawless for a sequel to a successful title.",83,85
locoroco 2,psp,Play UK,"LocoRoco 2 is as amusing as the original, but the differences between the two are marginal at best. Luckily, the swell controls and endearing visuals will enchant the audience of the first all over again.",82,85
locoroco 2,psp,Jolt Online Gaming UK,"It’s silly, elegant, strange, delightful, sometimes annoying, always cute, mostly easy (unless unlockables matter to you) a bit random, often clever and ultimately not that essential. It’s perhaps too whimsical for most people, and if you need meaningful story and immediate reward, it almost certainly isn’t for you. With the right mindset, though, it’s a real treat and something special for PSP owners to call their own.",82,85
locoroco 2,psp,3DJuegos,"LocoRoco 2 is a fresh and original experience for players and for the PSP line too. It has lost the surprise factor of the first game and the new features are not enough because offer a similar feeling. But LocoRoco means innovation, is an alternative expression and this generation needs it.",82,85
locoroco 2,psp,GameZone,"A great sequel to one of the PSP's best franchises, LocoRoco 2 is definitely a game fans of the original will want in their collection.",82,85
locoroco 2,psp,GameTrailers,"Despite new levels, moves, and critters, LocoRoco 2 is very much the same as the first. But when the same is this clever, it's hard to complain.",81,85
locoroco 2,psp,Eurogamer,"Ostensibly the same again, then, LocoRoco 2 nevertheless pulls its charm tight and burrows deeper into the mechanics, level layouts and set-pieces, presenting more elaborate rewards in visuals and gameplay, and doing a better job of sharing them with you so that you don't always feel as though you're searching for cuddly needles in a Teletubbies haystack. It comes across as a refined, more elaborately constructed sequel that remembers why it was good in the first place.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Meristation,"Even with some new touches and a increased difficulty, there are little changes in this sequel, which is probably the big problem here. The game keeps being as charming and enjoyable as the first one, so it´s perfect for those who love LocoRoco, but it lacks the sense of surprise and discovering of the first one.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Gamer.nl,"Locoroco 2 might be a little less unique than its predeccesor, but its concept is still going strong. The overal atmosphere and gameplay elements will most likely turn a smile on your face. And for a more than decent price the game is almost mandatory for every PSP-owner.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,PTGamers,"LocoRoco 2 may play it safe, choosing not to mess with a successful formula, but it adds a few nice twists here and there.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Kikizo,"Whether you're watching them hurtle along in the embrace of a rainbow wind, or guiding them through the intestines of a giant penguin, the squishy, smiling LocoRoco are as charming as they've ever been.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Level7.nu,"The second installment in the Loco Roco franchise offers us much of what we were offered in the first installment, with some minor yet appealing additions. The graphical style is just as cute as it was the last time around and the music is absolutely charming. Minor additions, such as a rhythm based minigame, really does a lot for the experience. The levels are more varied than in the first game and there are tons of things to do and find. It might not be a revolution, but it's an incredibly entertaining platforming experience.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Thunderbolt,"Cute, charming, and an utterly magical joy to play from start to finish, LocoRoco 2 is your new best friend.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Boomtown,"The sheer ingenuity of each stage keeps you going, but the scope of collectibles keeps you going back.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,LEVEL (Czech Republic),Concept of its predecessor multiplied in all ways and published. And it works perfectly in every part of this two-dozen-level fun. [Issue#173],80,85
locoroco 2,psp,AceGamez,"Despite the lack of evolution, I had a great time with LocoRoco 2. It's an improvement upon the original by most measures; bigger, better and more bad-ass, you might say, sacrilegious as it seems to apply Cliff Bleszinski's sales pitch to this sugary treat, but where Gears of War 2 delivered on its outlandish promises, LocoRoco 2 proves decidedly lacking.",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Eurogamer Portugal,Although there is not as much innovation as we hoped for LocoRocco 2 is followed by truly fun details and rises once again to the throne as best platform game to the portable Sony console. Don’t let yourselves be fueled by the aspect of this title. Anyone will surrender to the charms of LocoRocco 2.,80,85
locoroco 2,psp,games(TM),"A handheld game that pitches the balance between pick-up-and-play fun and engaging gameplay exactly. The clever level design and artistic merit are an added bonus. [Jan 2009, p.129]",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,GamePro,"Still, with its quirky presentation and interesting gameplay, LocoRoco 2 makes some fantastic improvements over its short-but-sweet precursor that should attract fans of the series and newcomers alike. [Mar 2009, p.80]",80,85
locoroco 2,psp,Playstation Official Magazine UK,"It's enough to make it feel new and shiny again, and well worth buying. [Jan 2009, p.100]",80,85
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GamingTrend,"This is not a title to sit down and play five minutes worth before you run out for errands. But if you devote some time to learning about horses and the racing itself, Gallop Racer 2006 is surprisingly rewarding.",88,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,IGN,"For fans of horses, racing, stats, or high functioning autistics this title stocks plenty to do. Tack on decent graphics and challenging (but not impossible) learning curve and you've got one satisfying niche title and a surprisingly great and wicked way to get your pony fix.",85,69

gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GameZone,"Despite that small problem, Gallop Racer 2006 is a small improvement from the last installment. With even more addicting betting, stat managing and racing, Gallop Racer 2006 improved for the better.",83,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,TotalPlayStation,"At the end of the day, though, you're still going to have to have a real interest in the sport.",80,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GameShark,"Still, it's as good as it gets in terms of an arcade horse racing game, and it's impossible to deny its addictive qualities. It's just a shame that Tecmo took the series into this more solitary direction.",75,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,Worth Playing,"As engrossing and deep as Gallop Racer 2006 is, it's still a horse-racing simulation, after all. This severely limits the appeal of the game, as most people are probably more interested in managing a football franchise or a baseball team than a horse farm.",75,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,Play Magazine,"For long time horse racing fans, Gallop Racer 2006 brings some great improvements in both the racing and breeding aspects above previous versions. [July 2006, p.72]",70,69

gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,Game Chronicles,"To each their own of course, but this game's developers probably could have put a bit more effort into Gallop Racer 2006 in order to make it more accessible for people who are curious, or just think the idea of a racing game with horses is cool. As someone who feels just like that, I can respect what Gallop Racer 2006 is about, but I'm a little disappointed too.",65,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,G4 TV,"Like many complex sim games, Gallop Racer can be as frustrating as it is rewarding.",60,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GameSpot,"Gallop Racer 2006 is pretty proficient; it's just not a very inviting experience. Fans who have already acclimated themselves to the generally noninclusive tone of the franchise shouldn't have too much trouble digging through the clumsy interface and often clinical appearance, but it's probably not worth the trouble to anyone else.",58,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GameSpy,"If you're the kind of gamer that likes to set two CPU-controlled combatants battle against each other in ""Street Fighter II"" and bet on the outcome with your friends, then this may be your type of game.",50,69
gallop racer 2006,playstation-2,GamesRadar+,Gallop Racer 2006 would be more fun if its presentation weren't so overwhelmingly confusing and its races so surprisingly difficult: it's a nasty combo.,40,69

We would have appreciated that, freed from the chains of AAA with huge budgets and the need to necessarily do better than its competitors, the Pieces Interactive title tried more things, did things differently, allowed itself a certain radicality.

The amount of detail it is able to cram into every facet of the experience can feel intimidating at first, but getting to know all of the features at their disposal will be both crucial and satisfying in the player's pursuit of the greatest city on Earth. Some performance issues place a damper on the experience, as does the absence of content available in other versions of the game.

It’s only a pity that performance issues betray the difficulty of squeezing a complex PC game into a handheld console, and that the game itself can sometimes feel a tad humourless.",70,67
cities: skylines,nintendo-switch,Vooks,"Despite the issues mentioned here, Cities Skylines on the Switch is still tremendous fun to play no matter if you’re playing it on the TV or in handheld mode.

Everything is here, nothing has been missed and there are bonuses for Switch owners not only with exclusive Mario cars and hats but also the ability to take it anywhere. A feature that cannot be overlooked. Rocket League is a really deep game. Following the clichéd easy to learn, hard to master approach holds Rocket League in good stead.

The one major negative is the resolution in undocked mode. I personally haven’t felt like it’s hindered a match for me, but it’s still pretty annoying.

While we were unable to get our hands on any of the physical packaging that Gaijinworks is known for, their localisation efforts shine through clearly. While strategy RPGs may be harder to come by these days, Summon Night 6 is a thirst quenching oasis for any genre-loving desert travellers.",80,71
summon night 6: lost borders,playstation-4,Hardcore Gamer,"Summon Night 6: Lost Borders excellently brings together visual novels and tactical RPGs. Fans of the visual novel portion may be turned off a bit by the English voice-over work, but the story itself is amusing. It may not be the most memorable out there, but it works as a slice of life with a supernatural twist. The tactical RPG portion of the game is its strongest point — and good enough to where any fan of that genre should consider Summon Night 6 to enjoy that alone. It has a much brisker pace than most and keeps the action moving when other games would have a lull. The graphics are strong — especially given it being a Vita game at its core — and the overall audio work is great thanks to a well-crafted soundtrack and strong design.",80,71

As the fifteenth anniversary project for the series, the creators produced an experience that resembles a crossover title rather than a typical mainline game. There is an expectation that players will be excited by each chapter's reveal of characters from an earlier Summon Night game, but can a person have nostalgia for something that wasn't available to experience in the first place? Because of the multitude of characters incorporated, the deep connection with characters and the cute asides that made Summon Night 5 stand out are lost.

Unfortunately, the charm that initially won me over couldn't completely save Summon Night 6's storyline from its dependence on nostalgia for something largely unfamiliar to Western gamers.

battlefield 3,xbox-360,VideoGamer,"Battlefield 3 isn't quite the Call of Duty killer many were wanting, then, and it's especially jarring to view EA's 'above and beyond the call' marketing brouhaha in light of the fact Battlefield 3 falls to its most damning lows when it's trying hardest to compete with the latter.",80,84
battlefield 3,xbox-360,GamesRadar+,"You should interpret this final score based on what you really want from a shooter. If you're a resolute campaign player who avoids multiplayer like a shark with a gun, BF3's single-player is simply not up to scratch in a year that has already given us Resistance 3 and Deus Ex.

If you are the type of gamer who only wants to play the game for its story then I would highly suggest you rent this game first so that you know what you are getting in to. The multiplayer is really where the fun is here and if you have been a fan of the franchise in the past then you should have a great time here.,80,84

There's a single player campaign that looks and sounds great but is extremely linear and scripted and provides no room for thinking outside the box.

It's a must-have.",100,89
battlefield 3,pc,GameShark,As a complete package Battlefield 3 absolutely delivers and if you don't have some angry agenda against Origin it's a must-play.

battlefield 3,pc,AusGamers,"There's certainly room for improvement, but there's no denying that so many different aspects of the first person shooter experience being dished out here are best-in-class. The multiplayer component alone is more than worth the price of admission and the solo campaign and cooperative offerings thankfully bring more to the table than they detract. With Battlefield 3, DICE have at long last raised the bar of PC gaming above the long-held bottleneck of console-parity, to bring us a game that's finally worth upgrading for and I dare say it carries with it a potential for a renaissance of the PC first person shooter.",98,89

battlefield 3,pc,SpazioGames,"The true strenght of DICE's new title is its multiplayer component: massive battles, vehicles, destruction and an exceptional overall polish of Frostbite 2 offer an incredible piece of entertainment and raise the bar for online competition. Coop mode is also enjoyable, although it won't last long: good to have an afternoon's worth of fun with a friend, it makes you wonder why the whole campaign hasn't been made available for this kind of cooperation.

I had so much fun engaging in community events and festivals, exploring wonderful bite-sized dungeons, and getting to know the citizens of Selphia that it’s hard not to recommend this game.

killzone 2,playstation-3,TheSixthAxis,"For the most part Killzone 2 is utterly, mesmerisingly brilliant and polished to perfection: the gunplay is solid, the controls, once tuned to your liking are superbly weighted and intuitive and the action, when good, is relentless. Time will tell whether or not the single player campaign will be held in as high regard as we’d all want it to be, but right here, right now, this is as good as it gets.

This is a game that leverages an atmospheric presentation and superb game design for something memorable and lasting. To quibble about a lack of cooperative play through the campaign or the omission of some other feature is to miss the point: Killzone 2 is meant to be a carefully laid out epic.

killzone 2,playstation-3,Meristation,"Killzone 2 rises from the ashes of the E3 2005 trailer to prove itself as even better; the most outstanding, immersive and technologically advanced first person shooter available for any console on the market. The dark and grim world created by Guerrilla hosts a crude conflict on Helghast soil, divided in 10 acts packed with a variety of situations portrayed with an epic tone. With a polished enemy AI, a huge multiplayer, a well balanced and powerful arsenal, 7.1 sound, great voice acting among some other strong points, few complaints can be made; only the lack of coop and some roughness in the allied AI. The rest is faithful and loyal to the promise Guerrilla made 4 years ago. Mission accomplished.",95,91

Guerrilla Games have stepped up to the plate and delivered very comparable results to “that preview video” that blew our collective minds in 2005.

What will stand the test of time is its pitch perfect grasp of said genre, its wonderfully taxing, take-no-prisoners assault on your senses and your trigger finger.

If you add an outstanding engine and design, what you get is the masterpiece everyone was waiting for. The only drawback is the plot, weak and affected by bi-dimensional characters.

Without the cell-processor and its amazing power, the game couldn’t support as many light sources as it does at once. Without the PlayStation 3, you cannot get the Killzone experience anywhere else. If that was the game’s goal, to prove that point to gamers, than they’ve done their job, and given PS3 owners one hell of a title in the process. The single player definitely hurts without cooperative play, but the multiplayer and overall stunning presentation should earn Killzone 2 a spot on any gamer’s shelf.",93,91

killzone 2,playstation-3,IGN UK,"For a developer whose previous games have been little more than average, Killzone 2 is a landmark achievement. Guerrilla has pushed the boundaries of what we’ve seen on PlayStation 3 by creating an all-action shooter that’s far closer to the original E3 teaser trailer than we could ever have imagined. It’s not perfect, sure, but it’s arguably the best FPS on PlayStation 3 and one that is, in this reviewer’s opinion at least, superior to ""Resistance 2.""",92,91

Yes, there are certainly moments where Revelations‘ origins as a 2012 portable game become apparent due to some muddy textures or occasional design choices, but those are some slight bumps in what is otherwise good to strong visual and gameplay design. Some other issues, like occasionally questionable voice acting and overwrought storytelling, are effectively mainstays of the series, at this point. The game is at its best when it focuses on a sense of isolation and mystery against oppressing odds, and while it occasionally deviates from this focus with more action-packed vignettes, most of the game is spent embracing this. Furthermore, the game’s structure, built on relatively short chapter segments, as well its raid mode, were clearly designed around the fact that it was originally a portable game, so this translates perfectly to Switch’s portable mode. As an added bonus, playing the game handheld with the smaller, lower resolution screen also helps cover up some of the visual imperfections.

With a story that finally explores the truth behind Dante's supernatural heritage and reveals the decisions that lead him to become a hero, DMC achieves something no previous installment could not.

kinect sports,xbox-360,IGN,"An easily accessible but surprisingly nuanced game. While there are some stumbling points here and there, such as the strange local multiplayer omissions in Table tennis or the muddled co-op mechanics of soccer, Kinect Sports still manages to be fun and different.",80,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Game Informer,"In the end, if you're looking for a way to show off your new Kinect, this provides a great complement to the pack-in title, Kinect Adventures.",80,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,GameWatcher,"There are moments of pure unadulterated joy packed into this sports compilation, and although it's all over rather rapidly, it's a great ride while it lasts.",80,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,RealGamer,Kinect Sports is a brilliant example of how good a mini-game compilation can be and proves to be an excellent demonstration of how well Kinect can work. It does lack a little depth in some areas but proves to be an excellent title to play with friends.,80,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Vandal,"Despite its ups and downs, and its limitations, Kinect Sports is a great game, with such an ability to turn something new, Kinect, into the center of many hours of fun and magic.",80,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,Joystiq,"Rare's work on Kinect Sports really demonstrates what the camera is capable when it's used by a capable developer. If you've already got the hardware to play it on, consider Kinect Sports a must-have.",80,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Giant Bomb,"I'll go so far as to say that the genre of sports-themed minigame collections probably isn't capable of really being revolutionized, but Kinect Sports gets dangerously close, simply by virtue of doing the one thing other motion-controlling technologies haven't been able to yet: Tracking your feet.",80,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,GameFocus,"I can say that Kinect Sports is now my second favorite Kinect title, right behind Dance Central.",80,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,Computer and Video Games,Every bit as fun as it is unoriginal. And football's ace.,79,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Cheat Code Central,"There's just not enough to do in this game. If you're playing by yourself, you may only get a few hours of unique content out of this game. You'll want to replay them, but it will only last so long. Families should have a blast with this though.",78,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,GameSpot,"This motion-controlled sports collection doesn't do much for solo players, but it's fun to play with friends both locally and online.",75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,TeamXbox,Kinect Sports is a robust package that offers a lot of variety on one disc.,75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Official Xbox Magazine,"The world won't be able to resist comparing Kinect Sports to Nintendo's Wii Sports gold standard, and the newcomer doesn't disappoint. Bowling and boxing are the two overlapping sports, and in the Kinect edition they're just as responsive and immediately accessible as you'd expect after four years of playing the Wii-mote version.",75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,3DJuegos,Kinect Sports is a fun and accessible sports game. This game does an admirable job as a launch tittle.,75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,1UP,"Kinect Sports works well enough as a launch title and has more than enough heft to ensure that it's not labeled as just a tech demo. Yes, there are some kinks that need to be addressed, particularly with the hardware, but if you're looking to pad out the library for your shiny new peripheral, Kinect Sports should be a definite consideration.",75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,GameZone,"Wii Sports has got some competition breathing down its neck with Kinect Sports. While the game doesn't support much outside of two-player competition (and even that's questionable) and has its reading issues, it's a well-planned collection that you shouldn't hesitate to pick up with your Kinect device. Let's hit the lanes!",75,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Eurogamer,"But as a lively, funny, polished and varied genre title that will slap a smile on the face of the most jaded cynic, Kinect Sports does its job admirably.",70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Telegraph,"As party games go, Kinect Sports is infectiously good fun. It's highly doubtful that this title will be enough to woo Wii owners over to the Xbox 360 on ts own. But for players who already own Microsoft's console and a Kinect sensor, it's more than worth a look.",70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,VideoGamer,"The football is shoddy, avatars glitch out and every now and again and the responsiveness of the game is occasionally brought into question - but none of this stops the experience being enjoyable. To conclude then, the answer to a question that has been on everybody's lips: is Kinect Sports better than Wii Sports?... Without a doubt.",70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Gamestyle,Overall Kinect Sports can be seen as a success and gives the peripheral a strong foundation. A must have default option for every Kinect owner it offers a great night in if you don't wish to venture outside.,70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Eurogamer Italy,"Kinect Sports in a good party game, and offers some great experiences like volley and ping pong. Just like any other multi-event game, it offers good and bad sports, but the final result is a nice and entertaining product.",70,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,Videogameszone.de,"Some mini games are really funny, others may be too simple. Soccer for example is only kicking with your feet. The players are moving automatically. Like all the casual stuff Kinect Sports will offer its complete potential at your party.",70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,NZGamer,"And that's really about it. Like Wii Sports, you will probably have a lot of fun while the Kinect technology is still new and exciting, but after that wears off, you'll only bring this one out for parties or over-energetic kids.",70,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Xbox Achievements,"Kinect Sports as a launch title though is extremely promising and it does show that Kinect could very well have a future in every living room – big living rooms that is.

kinect sports,xbox-360,SpazioGames,"An entertaining product, a must have for every Kinect fan out there. Some minigames and sports are not well developed as other, and some polish is lacking, yet you'll have a lot of fun with it.",68,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Everyeye.it,"Kinect Sports has some interesting activities, but some of the minigame are dull and laughable. Boxe and Table Tennis lacks precision, while Volleyball is the best activity included in the package.",65,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Destructoid,"There's some fun to be had here, for certain; it's definitely a more well-rounded package than something like Wii Sports. But ultimately, there aren't enough fresh ideas here to vindicate it as the new king of motion-controlled sports mini games.",65,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Gameplanet,"While Kinect Sports falls flat in the single player experience the fun to be had with friends carries it. Occasional motion control issues and the space required can hinder some of the fun but overall, and in a market flooded with choice, Kinect Sports holds its ground and should bring some high energy entertainment to your living room.",65,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,GameTrailers,"It would have made a nice pack-in, but package ends up feeling uninspired, relying on little more than the fast-fading novelty of motion controls.",64,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Extreme Gamer,"Kinect Sports showcases what Kinect can do in a sports setting. While its not a perfect package there is some fun to be had here in social gatherings. Some refinement is definitely needed, but hey, this is the first round. If a substitute Kinect version of Wii Sports sounds interesting then by all means pick up Kinect Sports.",62,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,games(TM),"Lushly presented, and with enough of that trademark Rare wit to keep you smiling, it's inoffensive enough fare before the real games arrive, but it's going nowhere Nintendo's not been already.",60,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,Gameblog.fr,"Kinect Sports is a nice surprise among the launch line-up of Kinect. Granted, it's nothing outstanding, but still good fun.

kinect sports,xbox-360,Eurogamer Portugal,"Kinect Sports can bee lots of fun when played with other people, but there is a huge Déjà Vu, especially when compared to Wii Sports.",60,73

kinect sports,xbox-360,Gamereactor Sweden,The football mini game is fun. The rest so-so. All of them suffer from Kinect's sluggish response.,50,73
kinect sports,xbox-360,Gamekult,"First of all destined to all the family and festive, Kinect Sports is a preview of the capabilities of Kinect, but it's not with this title that the Xbox 360 will widen the gap in the race for motion gaming.",50,73
