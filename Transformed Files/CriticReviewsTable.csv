5,345,1306,10,"Aside from some more inventive level design and a couple of new bells and whistles to keep you occupied, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is more of the same, which in our book is no bad thing. There’s little here that will surprise you, but it does just as good a job as the first game in providing a simple, grin-inducing few hours. We’ve rather enjoyed revisiting both titles this year, and we think fans old and new will still get a lot of fun out of them. Games as jovial as this one don’t come around very often these days, so if you’re after something light, you’ll have a ball.",80
6,220,1306,10,The colorful and crazy world of LocoRoco 2 returns with an excellent remastered.,80
7,255,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is a perfect opportunity for everyone: those who did not enjoy the title before and also those who keep a good memory and want to relive it. A game able to dazzle with his drawings and, above all, with its really great soundtrack.",80
8,200,1306,10,"A great port of a nine year old PSP game, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is as fun as it has ever been. Colourful and downright adorable, it’s a game that everyone can (and should) play.",80
9,129,1306,10,"The beautiful platformer from Japan Studio hasn’t lost an ounce of its charm, and in PS4, with the enhanced resolution, it looks and feels better than ever.",80
10,308,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered brings the well deserved high resolution uplift to a timeless classic. With an unchanged essence, LocoRoco 2 is still that charming and silly platformer we fell in love with ages ago. If you’ve never played it before, yet refuse do to so now... what's wrong with you, are you loco? Bad pun - but a great game.",80
11,84,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is proof that certain games never get old. Funny as nine years later, thanks to the high definition, the game amazes even more easily.",80
12,332,1306,10,"The superior game in the series. [Feb 2018, p.91]",80
13,221,1306,10,"Colorful & delightful, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is simply a great option for all players to revive one of the cutest experiences ever in platforming games. Don't miss it, if you have the chance; it's deeper than it seems.",78
14,408,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 still is a great game, but it doesn't offer anything you couldn't find in the original. Anyway, it's a good opportunity for new players to discover it.",78
15,225,1306,10,"Sony’s more esoteric puzzle and rhythm-based games are a bit of an acquired taste, with the pervading cheeriness and garish graphics serving as a turn off for some, but if you dig on these kind of games then LocoRoco 2 offers up a nice evolution upon the formula of the first title.",78
16,54,1306,10,"As with the first game, LocoRoco 2 Remastered is an unremarkable remaster of a delightfully charming game. The game’s bright and colourful visuals pop in higher resolutions, and the music comes to life through bigger speakers than the PSP offered. It’s a pity that like other PSP remasters, the cut scenes are a blurry mess, but that’s a minor complaint.",75
17,365,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 brings to the table a solid platform experience that resembles too closely its predecessor. However, the game is still highly recommended for all those who loved the first chapter.",75
18,399,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered is a solid enhancement over the original release that fails to iron out all of the kinks I would have liked. The simplistic platforming and inventive level design are occasionally let down by imprecise controls, although this is far from a dealbreaker.",70
19,387,1306,10,"LocoRoco 2 Remastered certainly gets the job done and while it is shorter than the original, there’s a ton of side content present. Its charming, minimalist detail looks great on the whole and runs as smoothly as one could hope for. The omission to that is with the low resolution cutscenes, which is somewhat ironic considering the emphasis on 4K in the marketing, but LocoRoco 2 Remastered is more of the same, which can only be a good thing.",70
20,256,1306,10,"After ten years of release, LocoRoco 2 back with colorful adventure and innovative gameplay. Though lack of game engine might be tricky to deal, this doesn't mean you can't have fun playing LocoRoco 2.",70
21,1,1306,13,"The game exudes a sense of innocence and charm that quickly sweeps away any frustrations, and leaves you whistling the theme song long after you put it down.",100
22,188,1306,13,"Once again, the LocoRoco 2 soundtrack takes center stage for me, with some great tunes scattered about the levels that are only aided by the different noises the LocoRoco and other creatures will make that seem to run in tandem with the music at times.",100
23,91,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is a shining example of how the PSP can be used to grab a share in the casual market along with hardcore gamers. LocoRoco 2 has so much charm that it is near impossible to hate. LocoRoco 2 can be enjoyed in long sittings, or quickly in a one-level run.",95
24,427,1306,13,You'll wind up playing through levels a couple of times past the point when you've unlocked everything - without even knowing there's nothing left to figure out - and it won't be a minute wasted.,95
25,110,1306,13,"The core game is one of the strongest platformers out there, and the mountain of extras pile on the enjoyment.",93
26,195,1306,13,"Simply put, if you own a PSP and do not buy this game, shame on you. You’ll be missing one of the best games of the year.",93
27,213,1306,13,"It may not be nearly as deep as the first game in terms of levels, but LocoRoco 2 delivers the same kind of visual flair, solid gameplay and musical addictiveness that the first game had.",91
28,413,1306,13,"Some will think the game too short, the gameplay repetitive and the experience too similar to the original to warrant forking out another £20, but those people are heartless grouches who no doubt spend their time scaring children and trampling on daisies. For everyone else, LocoRoco 2 is the most uplifting game available, not only on the title-shy PSP, but on any platform.",90
29,58,1306,13,"While not as great a progression as it could have been, LocoRoco 2 still manages to squash, bounce and squeeze its way into must-have territory, and is as pristine a slice of portable gaming as one could hope for. Visually arresting, a pleasure to play and an aural triumph (we dare you not to hum along to the soundtrack!), the love and attention that has been lavished on its production veritably oozes from the screen.",90
30,426,1306,13,"Even though LocoRoco 2 is a sequel, it is still one of the most original and addictive games that you will play on your PSP.",90
31,334,1306,13,"One of the must-have PSP games of the year, LocoRoco 2 delivers everything we could have wanted - more stuff to unlock and plenty of joyful, secret-packed levels full of weirdness and wonder.",90
32,331,1306,13,"Few games will make you smile more vibrantly. [Jan 2009, p.70]",90
33,333,1306,13,"If ""LocoRoco's"" too-cute art style turns you off or its odd gameplay still confuses you, trust me. Give LocoRoco 2 30 open-minded minutes. You won't regret it. [Mar 2009, p.74]",90
34,151,1306,13,No better and no worse than the original - but still an absolute joy in nearly every respect. This is a must-have title for the PSP.,90
35,63,1306,13,"If you enjoyed the first, or are interested in getting into the series, then I would highly recommend checking this game out. Plus you can’t beat the $20 price point, that is some serious bang for your buck.",90
36,239,1306,13,It is hard not to like LocoRoco 2. It relishes in a happy mood and does its best to spread the happiness to everyone that picks up the game.,90
37,408,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 wisely takes the torch of the first installment and succeeds again in PSP with an original title, fresh (though with the same basis than the first one) and extremely entertaining.",90
38,178,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is a pleasure. It lacks the depth of some of its contemporaries, to be sure, but in terms of sheer enjoyment value few games come close. It’s euphoric, and there’s more than enough content and unlockables to justify the $19.99 price tag.",90
39,124,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is a great continuation to the series and a game that most, if not all, PSP owners should have in their collection. Other than the minor gripe with the sensitive controls, there is a lot to love about this game. If you missed the opportunity to play the first, there is no real excuse to not get LocoRoco 2. At a very affordable price-point, you’re getting more than enough to satisfy your portable gaming needs for a long time.",90
40,313,1306,13,"A slightly improved, gleeful and irresistible triumph only tempered by familiarity. [Issue#174, p.76]",89
41,214,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 may not stray too far from the original, but it’s a fantastic and utterly charming piece of game design nonetheless.",88
42,179,1306,13,"Some nice additions to a game that still cannot fail to make you smile. [Christmas 2008, p.85]",88
43,325,1306,13,LocoRoco 2 could well be the most enjoyable mix of madcap nonsense and simple yet perfectly formed gameplay that there's been all year.,87
44,59,1306,13,"It is a game that is definitely the perfect game for any gamer in the family, from the hardcore to the most casual.",86
45,140,1306,13,"Still hands-down the cutest franchise on the PSP, LocoRoco 2 adds enough new ideas to its already unique gameplay to make it a great improvement on the original game.",85
46,293,1306,13,"It's bigger, better and happier. Let a little LocoRoco love into your life and you'll never regret it.",85
47,320,1306,13,LocoRoco 2 is basicly the same game than LocoRoco 1. That is by no means a negative fact as gameplay is exceptionally clever and fun and makes you fall in love with guiding the cute little LocoRocos to the goal. A platform game with a bit of puzzle and action in between has rarely been this much fun and never as heartwarming as now. [Jan 2009],85
48,67,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is a great title at a great price point. Its misgivings -- short playtime, lack of narrative substance and meaningless collectibles -- are easily trumped by the game’s character and solid gameplay.",85
49,174,1306,13,"Even if you don't normally go for cute games, LocoRoco 2 is worth checking out - even if you can only play it when no one else is watching.",85
50,41,1306,13,"The carefully crafted animations always transmit the right feel at the right time, whether you're bouncing over a spongy surface, gliding through windy areas, or sliding on ice. Everything in this game is charming; it has a cheery vibe you won't be able to find elsewhere.",84
51,115,1306,13,"For all the Blues Clues color palette, the flowers blowing in the breeze past dancing cacti, and a soundtrack that seems to recorded by the Alvin and the Chipmunks singing J-pop for a kindergarten show and tell on happy brownie recipes, it has the artistic polish that Sony is known for and a redesign that is nearly flawless for a sequel to a successful title.",83
52,324,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is as amusing as the original, but the differences between the two are marginal at best. Luckily, the swell controls and endearing visuals will enchant the audience of the first all over again.",82
53,232,1306,13,"It’s silly, elegant, strange, delightful, sometimes annoying, always cute, mostly easy (unless unlockables matter to you) a bit random, often clever and ultimately not that essential. It’s perhaps too whimsical for most people, and if you need meaningful story and immediate reward, it almost certainly isn’t for you. With the right mindset, though, it’s a real treat and something special for PSP owners to call their own.",82
54,4,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 is a fresh and original experience for players and for the PSP line too. It has lost the surprise factor of the first game and the new features are not enough because offer a similar feeling. But LocoRoco means innovation, is an alternative expression and this generation needs it.",82
55,147,1306,13,"A great sequel to one of the PSP's best franchises, LocoRoco 2 is definitely a game fans of the original will want in their collection.",82
56,145,1306,13,"Despite new levels, moves, and critters, LocoRoco 2 is very much the same as the first. But when the same is this clever, it's hard to complain.",81
57,82,1306,13,"Ostensibly the same again, then, LocoRoco 2 nevertheless pulls its charm tight and burrows deeper into the mechanics, level layouts and set-pieces, presenting more elaborate rewards in visuals and gameplay, and doing a better job of sharing them with you so that you don't always feel as though you're searching for cuddly needles in a Teletubbies haystack. It comes across as a refined, more elaborately constructed sequel that remembers why it was good in the first place.",80
58,255,1306,13,"Even with some new touches and a increased difficulty, there are little changes in this sequel, which is probably the big problem here. The game keeps being as charming and enjoyable as the first one, so it´s perfect for those who love LocoRoco, but it lacks the sense of surprise and discovering of the first one.",80
59,160,1306,13,"Locoroco 2 might be a little less unique than its predeccesor, but its concept is still going strong. The overal atmosphere and gameplay elements will most likely turn a smile on your face. And for a more than decent price the game is almost mandatory for every PSP-owner.",80
60,318,1306,13,"LocoRoco 2 may play it safe, choosing not to mess with a successful formula, but it adds a few nice twists here and there.",80
61,237,1306,13,"Whether you're watching them hurtle along in the embrace of a rainbow wind, or guiding them through the intestines of a giant penguin, the squishy, smiling LocoRoco are as charming as they've ever been.",80
62,242,1306,13,"The second installment in the Loco Roco franchise offers us much of what we were offered in the first installment, with some minor yet appealing additions. The graphical style is just as cute as it was the last time around and the music is absolutely charming. Minor additions, such as a rhythm based minigame, really does a lot for the experience. The levels are more varied than in the first game and there are tons of things to do and find. It might not be a revolution, but it's an incredibly entertaining platforming experience.",80
63,389,1306,13,"Cute, charming, and an utterly magical joy to play from start to finish, LocoRoco 2 is your new best friend.",80
64,31,1306,13,"The sheer ingenuity of each stage keeps you going, but the scope of collectibles keeps you going back.",80
65,240,1306,13,Concept of its predecessor multiplied in all ways and published. And it works perfectly in every part of this two-dozen-level fun. [Issue#173],80
66,9,1306,13,"Despite the lack of evolution, I had a great time with LocoRoco 2. It's an improvement upon the original by most measures; bigger, better and more bad-ass, you might say, sacrilegious as it seems to apply Cliff Bleszinski's sales pitch to this sugary treat, but where Gears of War 2 delivered on its outlandish promises, LocoRoco 2 proves decidedly lacking.",80
67,86,1306,13,Although there is not as much innovation as we hoped for LocoRocco 2 is followed by truly fun details and rises once again to the throne as best platform game to the portable Sony console. Don’t let yourselves be fueled by the aspect of this title. Anyone will surrender to the charms of LocoRocco 2.,80
68,451,1306,13,"A handheld game that pitches the balance between pick-up-and-play fun and engaging gameplay exactly. The clever level design and artistic merit are an added bonus. [Jan 2009, p.129]",80
69,132,1306,13,"Still, with its quirky presentation and interesting gameplay, LocoRoco 2 makes some fantastic improvements over its short-but-sweet precursor that should attract fans of the series and newcomers alike. [Mar 2009, p.80]",80
70,332,1306,13,"It's enough to make it feel new and shiny again, and well worth buying. [Jan 2009, p.100]",80
71,323,2028,7,"Possibly the best AI ever found in an RTS. [Aug 2003, p.77]",100
72,446,2028,7,"The maturation of a genre. More ""Civilization"" in scope, feel, and satisfaction than even the popular ""Age of Empires"" series, Rise of Nations is the world's first 4X RTS.",100
73,99,2028,7,"Hidden beneath that glossy surface is a game that takes almost everything that's annoying with real-time strategy titles and fixes it. It's deep, yet accessible. It's action-packed, yet manageable. In short, it's everything you could ask for in a real-time strategy game.",100
74,174,2028,7,"A well-designed, well-executed paragon of strategy gaming, although mouse-click maniacs may be disappointed that the game requires more thought than the typical RTS.",95
75,147,2028,7,"Rise of Nations revitalizes this genre because it blends the mechanics of real time and turn based strategy games into one. As weird as this may sound, the game does this flawlessly and expounds the gameplay a hundred fold.",95
76,187,2028,7,A worthy product with far more assets than shortcomings and a campaign game that will keep you playing.,94
77,296,2028,7,"A stunning achievement in RTS design. [Aug 2003, p.74]",93
78,140,2028,7,"In many ways, Rise of Nations is better than the strategy games that have come before it. It's smarter. It's more challenging. It gives you more to do.",93
79,453,2028,7,"Graphically, this game is amazing.",93
80,295,2028,7,"While other games may offer more to immediately get excited about, its charms will last long after their 3D glories wane, and for fast-paced but thoughtful strategy action, you simply cannot do any better.",93
81,111,2028,7,No current strategy title can give you the clash between horseback cavalry and industrial age tanks and howitzers as compelling as what Rise of Nations brings to the table.,92
82,81,2028,7,"Yes, Nations emphasizes military might over diplomacy, but it's still one of the most intelligent and riveting strategy games we've played in a long time. [18 July 2003, p.83]",91
83,11,2028,7,A towering aggregation of everything that's good about strategy gaming.,90
84,19,2028,7,"The second, more significant disappoint that RON inflicts upon the gamer is the mind numbing singularity of the conquest battles. As much as I love toasting the opposition into roasted marshmallow oblivion, doing so 22 times in a row gets a little old.",90
85,110,2028,7,"As solid as bedrock. [July 2003, p.119]",90
86,10,2028,7,"Merging the best of the historical strategies of Civilization and Empire Earth with the dynamics and appeal of the Age of Empires and C&C, giving this RTS the level of detail reserved for turn-based strategies and simulations. And the best thing is - this really works!",90
87,394,2028,7,"Animation of the beautifully rendered characters and unit models particularly livens up the screen, and the attention to detail is often quite remarkable.",90
88,82,2028,7,One of the most impressive strategy games we've seen in years.,90
89,294,2028,7,"Aside from the lackluster sounds, Rise Of Nations has Gameplay that rocks and beats out any recent RTS offerings and at a pace that you can be done in 90 minutes or less - all of which makes this an ideal game for almost any gamer.",90
90,142,2028,7,An enormous game... Classic real-time gaming simply doesn't get much better than this.,90
91,21,2028,7,"Rise of Nations is a great fusion of several recent and classic strategy titles. It combines Empire Earth with Age of Empires, puts in a dash of Civilization and Risk, and then mixes it all together with a ton of options for you to play around with.",90
92,96,2028,7,"There is a lot to be said for the city-centric game design, the intricate unit balancing, the smart AI, and the catchy, quickie action, although there isn’t anything here to make the jaded sit up and shout.",88
93,159,2028,7,Has a huge amount of game play options and is one of the most intriguing RTS games I have played since Civilization. The only concern I had was with the amount of horsepower required by your computer to play in a bigger game.,88
94,115,2028,7,Where Rise of Nations really sets itself apart from the pack is with two innovations: territorial control and a big Risk-like macro game.,83
95,213,2028,7,"A game that borrows extensively but cautiously from the TBS genre, doing what it does extremely well but offering next to nothing which is new.",82
96,132,2028,7,"Rise of Nations’ biggest weakness—lack of variety—becomes obvious. Every nation is the same, except for some bonus modifiers; there really aren’t that many units; and in the end, you wind up wielding them as a jumbled horde.",80
97,105,2028,7,"Playing Rise of Nations won't make your jaw drop in amazement, but you'll probably still have lots of fun as long as you like RTS games. [Aug 2003, p.74]",80
98,253,2028,7,What truly sticks out about this real-time strategy game is that it never lets its engrossing depth create a dull moment.,80
99,49,2028,7,"Like its brethren, it is good - but without being amazing or breathtakingly original. [Aug 2003, p.72]",80
100,47,2028,7,"This is as unconventional as a conventional real-time strategy game can probably get, at onece like everything and nothing you've ever played. [July 2003, p.66]",80
101,78,203,15,"Sega's loss is Nintendo's gain: Bayonetta, twirling away from a gigantic demon's maw and smacking the highest choir of angels on the nose, has just given Wii U its first true classic. [Nov 2014, p.100]",100
102,140,203,15,"It is a masterclass in pure, unadulterated action-game design, where its insane eye-popping visuals meld effortlessly with some of the sharpest, most joyful combat to have ever graced a video game.",100
103,233,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is the perfect action game. It oozes style and boasts gameplay that's both refined and lacking in excess. The combat is so purely entertaining that it's easy to lose yourself in the almost-zen flow of dodging, countering and kicking enemies to death.",100
104,93,203,15,"Quite possibly the best action game ever made, Bayonetta 2 is a pure gem of wonder, filled with epic fights, perfect gameplay, a magnificent visual and sound environment and even a multiplayer mode which fits perfectly within the format. A diabolical masterpiece that no Wii U should go without.",100
105,67,203,15,"It not only plays great, but there's so much style involved in just about every animation. Dashing turns you into a panther, double-jumping allows you to sprout butterfly wings, hovering turns you into a crow. Everything from the snapshot ""photo finish"" effect of completing a challenge room is painstakingly detailed.",100
106,148,203,15,"With Bayonetta 2, Wii U has its trump card: a queen of spades that takes advantages on almost every game of the genre and hits us right in the heart. It's an outstanding production, beautifully executed, with state of the art mechanics and ridiculously generous. And it can be enjoyed by everyone as its difficulty and handling can be adjusted. Definitely a beat them all no one has the right to ignore.",100
107,200,203,15,"Intense, gorgeous and thrilling to play, this is Platinum’s best game so far...A non-stop climax of excitement from the moment you start the Prologue, this is one of those games that demands to be played.",100
108,83,203,15,"Buy it if you liked the first one. Buy it, if you love it over the top all the way. Buy it if you love video games. Buy a Wii U if you have to. Bayonetta 2 sings all its praises in a celebration to this hobby of ours. But don't make the mistake of not playing it.",100
109,170,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is a triumphant return for the series and for Platinum Games. Extreme bosses, a crazy good style and an addictive co-op mode are just the icing on top of an excellent fighting system. Go get it now for your Wii U.",100
110,199,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 doesn’t drastically change the already wacky formula that the first game introduced, but it’s a bigger and more nuanced version of its predecessor. It’s also the best game of its kind in years. If you’ve ever enjoyed this breed of reflex-heavy, hyperactive, ludicrous action game, Bayonetta 2 is a no-brainer.",100
111,202,203,15,"The sheer polish applied to every part of Bayonetta 2 is something every major studio should aspire to: the exceptional and wide-ranging soundtrack, the huge number of unlocks, the Nintendo easter eggs, the “making of” materials, and the unlockable characters that bring their own style. Not a single thing has been held back. In this second adventure, Bayonetta over-delivers in every regard, and it will be a long time before another fighting game threatens her crown.",100
112,408,203,15,"Platinum Games manages to improve everything we knew and loved from the first game, creating a master piece everybody should play.",100
113,255,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is the best action game ever made. Masterclass in terms of combat system, depth and accessibility, with frantic and intense progress. Unforgettable challenging boss battles, full of content to unlock and a lovely main character.",100
114,87,203,15,"It's the obsession for detail that makes Bayonetta 2 so special. It might not be a unique game, but clearly one that's not common.",100
115,280,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 doesn’t do anything particularly new, but it does serve as an improvement of an already excellent action title, perfecting the formula even further.",100
116,55,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is a Game of the Year contender, which comes extremely recommended.",100
117,74,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 will challenge some people. It will make the uncomfortable. It's transgressive in numerous ways, and with that comes the potential to offend. But in causing offence, Bayonetta 2 encourages conversation, and that's the very definition of a good work of art.",100
118,63,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is a relentlessly entertaining ride from start to finish, with pacing meticulously designed to wring every last drop of adrenaline out of you before reigning things in with a quiet, humorous aside.",100
119,225,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is perfect on all levels that supports a flawless gaming engine, exceptional graphics and kick-ass female protagonist.",100

140,54,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is something new blended with something familiar, improved in every way possible. Few other games can top it for sheer audacity and ballsiness, and if this is the last time we’ll ever see the leggy witch, then she’s going out with one hell of a bang.",90
141,279,203,15,"One of the best games to ever grace the Wii U. The sequel feels tighter, less obnoxious, and is a blast to play through.

142,70,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 expresses a meticulous devotion to excessive elaborateness of style and action. It's a calculated brawler that not only minds its rules with painstaking diligence, but trusts its operator with how to best interpret them.

It's fast, intense and ridiculous, all with an entertaining story and a protagonist that is forever subverting and playing with her audience.

If you love the action genre get this game. It's an order.",90
147,403,203,15,"Bayonetta 2 is the high-flying return of everyone's favorite Umbra Witch. Platinum Games pushes to the Wii U to its limit with fast action, magnificent vistas, and huge bosses.

It runs without a hitch at 60fps, looks incredible in both handheld and tabletop modes and offers an addictive free-flowing combat formula that sprinkles in platforming, light exploration and a ridiculous story to create something that you simply need to experience. If you’ve never played it for before, you’re in for a treat. If you’ve already played it, it’s even more bewitching as a handheld gem.",90

Yeah, its the same game that we already played on the Wii U and it doesn't offer anything new aside from the amiibo functionality.

Having said that, this still is an instant classic.",86

180,230,203,6,"Bayonetta 1 & 2 is a very good remaster that brings the witch into the modern age with 720p 60fps display, and above all portability. The only drawback is that the first game shows its age, especially when in portable mode, but the gameplay makes all those complaints irrelevant.",85
181,84,203,6,"Bayonetta 2 represents the highest point touched by the action genre, with a superfine and refined gameplay, and a totally out of the box narrative. The Switch version brings small improvements to the technical sector, and enjoys a portability that everyone now craves.",80

192,188,307,8,"Burnout Dominator may not revolutionize the series or even offer a significant upgrade over Revenge, but it still delivers the goods when it comes to hardcore, fast paced, killer crashing, racing action. What else could a virtual masochist want out of this series?",83

202,99,307,8,"Though some will lament the missing crash mode and others will wonder why they can't compete online, the franchise's likely swan song on PS2 nonetheless goes out on a high note, cementing its reputation as the premier arcade racing series on a platform known for its racing titles.",80

207,145,307,8,"It's a decent stop-gap if you're waiting for ""Burnout 5"" to hit stores, but most will be able to milk it for all it’s worth via rental. If the series continues to lumber on like this, its fans will inevitably burn out.",77

309,213,792,9,It's rare that a game can hit the mark in so many different and often conflicting areas. Fallout 3 offers freedom without sacrificing a focused story.

333,4,792,9,"Fallout 3 brings back a legendary saga to the foreground of video games and it does it with remarkable successes. Graphically it is a very powerful title, the ambience is carefully planned, and its size, freedom and scope are its principal highlights.

334,197,792,9,"The only disadvantage of the PS3-version of the game compared to the PC-version concerns the handling. The aiming via stick is very difficult and if you want to crack a lock, you have to be very skilled too.",89
335,223,792,9,"It's the big Christmas action game with brains and choices, and with an interest in constructing a refreshingly different world from all those austere near-future manshoots that clog up the shelves.

363,432,792,17,"Fallout 3 masterfully creates a parallel universe for players to explore and lose dozens of hours in. No other game of this console generation comes close to offering the amount of content, freedom of choice, and level of immersion that can be found here.",96
364,155,792,17,"So what you have here with Fallout 3 is a great addition to the series, even if you are a die-hard fan of Black Isle Studios’ work with the previous Fallout titles. It has some slight faults, but the quality of the rest of the package more than makes up for it all.",96
365,325,792,17,"Bethesda's apocalyptical Fallout 3 belies its own jaw-dropping desolation by delivering a near-faultless action RPG that manages to not only execute compelling first-person gameplay but also provides an influential and in-depth character evolution system that's supported by an intriguing storyline and a mind-boggling game world that screams ""Game of the Year"" at every turn.",96
366,232,792,17,"The game combines the strengths of two fine RPG series, which for Fallout 3 means compelling narrative in a post-apocalyptic setting and immersive gameplay in a huge, open-ended world. All of this just leaves one question to answer: is Fallout 3 a contender for Game of the Year? And the answer: undeniably, yes.",96
367,439,792,17,"It isn't quite perfect, but no game of this size and scope ever really will be, and ultimately nothing can prevent Fallout 3 from being one of the greatest role-playing experiences on the console to date.",96
368,214,792,17,"If you can put in the time and commit to exploring this detailed and carefully designed wasteland, then Fallout 3 can't help but satisfy and engage you in ways that very few games ever have.",95

Packed to the gills with the incredibly deep Fallout mythos, you can play through the twenty odd hours of main quest but come back to experience the 50+ hours of side quests dotted throughout this freaky, radiated reality.",95
370,427,792,17,"In the end, Fallout 3 feels like a Fallout game, and that is absolutely the highest compliment. Despite the changes, much of the charm and fun of the franchise remains intact, and despite the similarities to Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, I never felt that I was playing anything but a Fallout game.",95
371,194,792,17,"Fallout 3 is an experience in itself, and while it may not offer as much replay value as Oblivion, it’s so much more then an “Oblivion with guns”.",95
372,110,792,17,"This game is massive, and as your character’s stature in the Wasteland grows, so does the excitement. It’s not a true sequel to the Fallout series, but as a fan of the games of old, I found it to be every bit as good.",95
373,195,792,17,"There is more gameplay in this game than any four other holiday titles combined, and every minute of it is compelling.",95
374,28,792,17,"Hardcore Fallout fans will either hate Fallout 3 because it's not Fallout or Fallout 2, or they'll love it because it's still a great game set in one of the best freaking universes ever.

377,440,792,17,"The people at Bethesda are well-known for making games with incredible longevity and replay value, and Fallout 3 is another solid, worthy achievement by this studio – you can be sure that down the road there’ll be expansions or downloadable content for this already sizeable experience.",95

379,408,792,17,"Definitely, no videogame fan should let Fallout 3 escape. There are so many things you can do, places you can explore and situations to experiment, that regardless the many times we could say this is a superb title, an instant classic, there is no better way to understand the reason for such praise than to get lost in the ruinous Washington D.C. region.",95

381,147,792,17,"If the third-person perspective was better, Fallout 3 would’ve been an almost perfect RPG. Even with that said, everyone needs to spend time showing off how amazing VATS is since it is pure ecstasy.",94
382,145,792,17,"Tthere’s a constant flow of surprises and excellence packed into this RPG. Everything is set at such a high caliber that the negligible flaws and inconsistencies come across as much larger blemishes than in most games, but they can’t tarnish the overall experience.",94
383,52,792,17,"Fallout 3 is a fantastic game. It has its flaws, as does any game, but it is so immersive and can give you a heck of a lot of entertainment for your money that it's worth the pricetag. If you liked Oblivion, you will no doubt fall in love with this game as I did. Maybe not Game Of The Year, but it is a worthy contender for that top spot.",94

386,205,792,17,"But really, those why find the missions a little repetitive are missing the point, because while Fallout 3 is certainly not perfect, the goods outweigh the bad to such a degree that the negatives really can be ignored. Whether you want to trade, rob trade caravans, become a melee combat specialist or perfect killing from 500 yards, the possibilities are endless.",94
387,438,792,17,"In almost all respects, Fallout 3 is a staggering, genre-defining achievement - marrying an utterly immersive world, memorable characters, incredible production values, some of the most inspired RPG mechanics ever devised and so much heart. It might not steamroll the epic ""Oblivion"" in the manner we all hoped, but maybe that was simply asking too much. Instead, Fallout 3 stands as the perfect companion piece - a near unparalleled RPG that stands so far ahead of the majority of the games on 360 that it would be a crime against gaming not to laud this title as anything other than a masterpiece.",93
388,62,792,17,"Different from Oblivion but bound to be compared to it, Fallout 3 is deep, rewarding and as open-world as you get, with only a few issues that warrant a sight raise of the eyebrow.",93
389,240,792,7,"A vast and open world of unimaginable possibilities opens in front of you in Fallout 3. Great story, flawless combat system, and the option to choose your own way makes it a hot candidate for game of the year. [Nov 2008]",100
390,1,792,7,"Faults be damned, though; this is the kind of hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often, and when it does, you'd be a fool not to play it and enjoy the hell out of it and look forward to the day (next-next-gen?) when the fidelity of open-world RPGs takes another big step closer to the uncanny valley's far side.",100
391,142,792,7,"Yes, Fallout 3 is a lot like Oblivion (with guns!), but it's a superior game in nearly every way, as it features a more engaging storyline, impeccable presentation, and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay. While the jury is still out on whether or not hardcore Fallout enthusiasts will accept the game as part of the storied franchise, Fallout 3 is a must-have title for most RPG fans, as well as one of the finest games of this generation.",100
392,115,792,7,"That’s the beauty of survival, and this world of fallout: It feeds on adventure and breathes in freedom, yet it dreams of order and the safety of the Vault. I can describe it, explain it, tell it in finely chosen words, but I can never make you fully understand for as long as you sit and listen. But even if I die, I do not worry. There will come a time when you will seize that lever and open that metal door, and it is then I will return.",100
393,99,792,7,"The ironically devastated world of Fallout has never been better realized than in Fallout 3, offering a vast landscape that is almost relentlessly bleak in its hopelessness. It's absorbing, immersive, paradoxically beautiful, and kind of depressing to play over long periods of time.",100
394,389,792,7,"I hesitate to say, at this early stage, that this is actually a better game than either Fallout 1 or 2, but it very well may be; at the least, it is game-of-the-year material.",100
395,376,792,7,"A massive, enthralling achievement.",100
396,57,792,7,"After this game-experience negative points are hard to find. Sure, the radio program is not mind-blowing and the third-person-view is suboptimal. But this doesn’t matter, as Fallout 3 is wonderful and even a class better than Bethesda’s last title - Oblivion.",100

399,246,792,7,"Combining 1950s art style with a sci-fi mix, gives the game a unique heartbeat. Fallout 3 is a game that will last in your mind long after you’re done playing it, thanks to its memorable characters and adrenaline filled combat. We can finally derive at a conclusion that Fallout 3 is NOT Oblivion with guns!",97
400,213,792,7,It's rare that a game can hit the mark in so many different and often conflicting areas. Fallout 3 offers freedom without sacrificing a focused story. It delivers fantastic combat without forgoing a deep role-playing system. The characters you meet are engaging and oftentimes hilarious without feeling out of place in this harsh world.,96
401,21,792,7,"The PC version's controls are certainly sharp and I found myself pulling off many more headshots and quick kills with a mouse and keyboard than I could on the console counterparts, but if you really do want to play with a gamepad, Fallout 3 does fully support the 360 controller on the PC as well.",96

413,296,792,7,"But Fallout 3 has fidelity to its predecessors in more important ways, such as offering an incredible depth of role-playing opportunities. [Holiday 2008, p.54]",91
414,175,792,7,The unique Fallout-Atmosphere has survived the changes in the gameplay without a scratch! Players can easily overlook the shortcomings of the German synchronization – and maybe it is even because the game provides such a high level of quality that it seems as if true highlights are missing. Unrivalled in freedom of choice and complexity it has become a worthy heir to the great line of previous Fallout games. [Issue # 16],91
415,303,792,7,"Minor niggles aside, Fallout 3 is almost entirely spectacular. Everything from the graphics, to the sound, to the plot is first-rate. The VATS system worlds like a charm, and it’s so easy to get the hang of, you’ll be cracking skulls like there’s no tomorrow. [Dec 2008, p.55]",90
416,413,792,7,"This is a massive game: in a month that's seen the release of five or six of the year's best titles, I reckon this is the absolute peach. It's packed with interesting places, with choices to make, with that nebulous sense of adventure you only find in the best RPGs.",90

427,4,792,7,"Fallout 3 brings back a legendary saga to the foreground of video games and it does it with remarkable successes. Graphically it is a very powerful title, the ambience is carefully planned, and its size, freedom and scope are its principal highlights. It is as captivating a game in the beginning as easy to forget in the mid term; despite this, we can say that it is a title that is worth trying.",89
428,136,792,7,"This is a good game. It’s a really good game. It’s only failing is that it has a mark of greatness upon it and, ever so cruelly, fails to completely achieve it.",83
429,199,792,7,"Across the three platforms, the PC version of Fallout 3 is the best, provided you have hardware that can handle it. The PC version has better lighting, a bit more graphical detail, and just looks better, overall. It's a Games For Windows Live game, too, so if you're dead set on playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller, you can do that on the PC, as well. Additionally, it has achievements, just like the 360 version, though they're kept separately--this means you could technically double up, play the game to completion on both the 360 and the PC, and have double the points as a result.",80

431,31,792,7,"Bethesda has done the Fallout series justice and should be proud of the game they made, unfortunately, the scope of the project was too much for them and the PC game felt unfinished in places, but simply outstanding in other areas.",80
432,322,792,7,"Dark humor, brutal combat system, riveting story, wide opportunities for exploration and development in the unforgettable postapocalyptic setting. No, it's not a holy Grail some rpg fans were looking for, but a very decent game nonetheless. [Dec 2008]",80
433,7,792,7,"Grim post-nuclear romanticism of Fallout 3 is going to be a huge revelation for console owners. Those who spent the last 11 years exploring the nuclear wastelands of America on the PC, will probably see this game as nothing more than Bethesda’s attempt to fix the mistakes of Oblivion.",75
434,48,792,7,"The main quest is pretty short and unimpressive, but this was never the “backbone” of a Fallout game. I’d estimate that an uninterrupted run through the main story could take around 3-4 hours, while not being particularly juicy.",72
435,38,792,7,"Fallout 3 is just mediocre. It’s bogged down by too many problems, engine issues, and poor writing to really wrestle its way into classic status.",70

442,365,44,7,"Rise of the Godslayer succeeds in improving a fairly good MMORPG. Fans asked for more content, Funcom delivered. Khitai offers a lot of things to keep you busy and the alternate advancement system gives players even more options to customize their characters.",85

The new characters, including the imposing Giants, the enhanced visuals, larger voice cast, more collectibles, smoother gameplay, and a deeper overall experience makes for a game Skylander fans will absolutely want to pick up. It also brings those new into the franchise a chance to experience a more refined title then the first.",88

551,195,2200,17,"What value you get out of Skylanders Giants is tied directly to how much you'll be willing to spend on it and while it's definitely pricey, the added value of a physical product that is actually a pretty well made and exciting piece of tech softens the blow a bit. The game itself is way more fun than it has any right being, and while it doesn't pull off its concepts perfectly, it does manage to stay interesting throughout, with tons of clever little ideas and nods to other games.",80

617,82,9,8,"24: The Game isn't a bad game, but it isn't a new, interesting or exciting one either. It's one of those depressing tie-in games where the proposal came before the creativity - as, I suspect from the banality of all the interactive sequences, did the script.",60

622,118,9,8,Bottom line is that when you’re in the game you’ll be angry and want your money back but as soon as the cutscenes roll around fans will be pleased. It’s amazing how one side of this game got so polished while the other was all but neglected.,59
623,41,9,8,"The game will only take you about eight hours to complete and with no multi-player modes or unlockables, there is no actual replay value. If you want to get 24 hours out of it, play it three times.",56

625,393,9,8,"Calling 24: The Game a disappointment is a bit of an understatement. Its uninspired third-person shooter gameplay and sluggishly dull driving sections really do fail to capture the brilliance of the TV show, with the mini-game puzzles and the rare idea representing the only spark of creativity in the entire game.",50
626,451,9,8,"If Sony Cambridge had placed as much emphasis on the gameplay mechanics as it had recreating the show’s style, then 24: The Game would have been an excellent action title. [Apr 2006, p.102]",50

629,68,9,8,"The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse.",50

634,453,9,8,"The game never truly matches the intensity of the show itself though, mostly because it's placed between seasons of the show which have already aired, so you know from the beginning that certain characters are going to be ok, even when their lives are supposedly threatened.",45
635,213,9,8,"But the actual game itself really is simply poor. There's almost nothing redeeming to find during any section where the analog sticks are in use, and being that this is a game and not a TV show, that simply doesn't cut it.",42
636,264,1196,1,Pit's triumphant return doesn't just represent another classic that Nintendo should be proud of it also raises the bar to truly heavenly heights. If this monumental title represents what the 3DS is capable of then owners should consider themselves blessed,100

645,124,1196,1,"Kid Icarus: Uprising is without a doubt a must have title for the 3DS. The single player campaign is engaging and offers tons of character customization, and the multiplayer portion sports a very competitive arena. The amount of value here is incredible; this just isn't a game that can be played through once and put down. It's been a long time since Pit was the main character in a game, and we can easily say it was worth the wait.",91
646,277,1196,1,"One of the most attractive, exhilarating, entertaining and outrageously fun titles so far on 3DS. While Mario has recently brought his style of gaming bliss to the handheld, Uprising provides a substantial amount of content, its own brand of adrenaline pumping set pieces and wonderful humour. It sweeps you along at breakneck speed, and is a must-have title for that very reason.",90
647,82,1196,1,"Its weave of systems hauls you back in to replay stages time after time; the sense of progress and acquisition is a powerful, irresistible loop.

Reaching for the sky.",90
648,451,1196,1,"A triumph in artistry and gameplay, overcoming the frequently problematic process of reviving an old franchise.

649,55,1196,1,"A thoroughly entertain[ing] mix of air- and ground-based shooting that never slows down, throwing all manner of new challenges at the player, incentivising the whole process to ensure replay levels are as high as possible. The intense multiplayer options are merely the icing on an already very delicious cake.",90
650,171,1196,1,"It's been more than two decades since the last game in the Kid Icarus series, but Uprising proves it was worth all the waiting with excellent action, beautiful graphics and so much unlockables that you probably won't need another game for your Nintendo 3DS this year.",90
651,148,1196,1,"After a 25 years retreat, Pit takes off again to defeat Medusa once more. More than a rail shooter, Kid Icarus Uprising is a true old school gem and one of the most ambitious 3DS titles to date. It's still tiresome to play for your wrist sometimes,and the plastic stand still requires you to find the better position, but the experience is worthwhile.",90
652,233,1196,1,"I already know reactions to this game will be polarized, and it basically comes down to whether people can get used to those (again, admittedly) uncomfortable controls... But I can't help but be glad I stuck it out through the overlong adjustment period. The upbeat, funny, deep action game that comes after is totally worth the investment.",90

659,181,1196,1,"Although full of kitsch, this excellent game uses it the way you will assume is one of its virtues. The game looks splendid, its gameplay is even better, and although the game enjoys killing your wrist, none of you should miss it.",90

668,41,1196,1,"It's hard to find much to complain about in Kid Icarus: Uprising. The game looks and sounds very good, but the pixels are extremely noticeable and the music score, while rekindling some classic themes, lacks a certain epic quality.",86

976,213,2176,16,"Neither brilliant nor terrible. Instead, it falls into that weird ether world of limbo, a game that's good in parts and weak in others, leaving you with a feeling of only mild satisfaction. It's like waking up with a great hunger to a plate of luke-warm eggs.",80
977,142,2176,16,"Overall I enjoyed Silent Hill 4 just as much as the previous games. Although the initially slower pace and more non-conventional puzzles might annoy some gamers, those who hang in there are in for a hellish treat well worthy of the creepy Silent Hill brand.",80

997,394,2176,16,"We just can't get that excited about Konami's latest venture. Maybe it's the annoying plot twist that happens halfway through the game - think ""Ico"" with a plaster cast - that essentially forces you to replay through all the frightening locations you've already visited.",72

1023,427,2001,2,"The Rebirth mode is a welcome addition, and it offers a harder quest, more enemies and new puzzles, but touch screen support is minimal, and the knifing battles feel more like hastily created mini-games rather than well-integrated portions of the quest.",74
1024,280,2001,2,"In the wake of Resident Evil 4's Game of the Year honors, it's nice to see where the series got its roots, but it also reminds us just how far the series has come.",72

1029,267,2001,2,"If Capcom's aim was to deliver the original Playstation experience with knobs on to the DS, then that aim has been met and exceeded. It looks the same, it sounds the same; not that is a bad thing - far from it, the DS probably isn't capable of improving things by that much.",70

1032,9,2001,2,"There are many good elements to Resident Evil: Deadly Silence, but it ultimately fails to excel on the two levels it attempts: it fails as nostalgia because the weaknesses of the original get in the way of the fun, and it fails as a new game because neither the environment nor story translate to a unique or very scary experience anymore.",70
1033,115,2001,2,"If you haven't experienced the original Resident Evil, now is your chance to embrace a classic. Gamers who have played it before, however, won't find quite enough extra here to justify paying for the privilege of doing it all over again.",67

1037,132,2001,2,"It's almost gut-wrenching to realize that with it has come all the problems that plagued it in the past. Add to this the newly implement touch-screen mini-games that feel like more of a distraction than an addition, and you're left with an experience that only the hardest of the hardcore fan could stomach.",60
1038,293,2001,2,"While there is nothing new for veterans or anything to change the minds of the pessimists among you, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is a good game that commemorates a classic series. Too bad that it’s pretty much redundant as a portable game.",60

1040,413,2001,2,"For those who have played the game to death on an older console, the 'Rebirth' mode and assorted other extras may offer enough incentive to drop the cash on it again, and for the ten people who are yet to play Resident Evil, it's certainly worth experiencing for the first time, despite its rather aged control scheme.",60
1041,384,2001,2,"Great games never really die, they just get reanimated.",60
1042,142,2001,2,"There's really no reason to go back and replay it. I have to admit a certain amount of nostalgia in the early going, especially as I remembered cool parts of the game, but that's not a compelling reason to fork over the bucks for this remake.",50

1045,136,2001,2,"In my opinion the 10-year-old game this cartridge contains just does not hold up in 2006 and the clear lack of consideration for the needs of the platform earn it a below average ""C-"" score.",42
1046,82,2001,2,"Placed on a handheld, the gravitas of the shock scares is gone, and with unrealistic graphics and a cheese factor turned up to eleven, any feeling of genuine creepiness is lost. While it does keep all the flaws described here, the GameCube remake does at least offer beautiful graphics and some decent shocks.",40
1047,99,2001,2,"Now, if ""Rebirth Mode"" was more than just the original game with some half-hearted minigames tacked on -- if it sported updated graphics and a more intuitive control scheme, things would be different.",40
1048,1,290,7,"It's one of those sequels where all of the evolution takes place underneath the façade -- a game you've got to pick up and feel all the subtle differences. And of course, if Blood is your first Brothers experience, well, it's hard to imagine going back to anything less authentic and strategic.",95

1052,213,290,7,"Only an incremental improvement on the original. The greater flexibility of the AI and the new multiplayer options are certainly welcome additions, but the game still feels... more like Brothers in Arms v1.5 than a full sequel.",88
1053,140,290,7,"Earned in Blood offers a rather similar experience to its excellent predecessor, with improved enemy artificial intelligence and additional multiplayer options. The novelty has worn off just a bit, though.",87

1061,82,290,7,"EiB feels grittier - closer to its fascinating yet fearful inspiration - than any other military shooter out there. Much of that feel comes from the credible mission design and AI already mentioned but a significant portion stems from fundamentals like the way the weapons look, sound and perform.",80

1063,390,290,7,"The first-person caper is satisfyingly immersive thanks to some outstanding graphical touches — heavy rain splatters neatly on Jeeps and we can even see Red’s freckles in close-up.

1064,78,290,7,"Earned In Blood might not seem like a radical departure from the original but the gloriously cascading AI and open maps have effectively transformed it into a very special WWII experience.

1112,115,290,16,"Even with the improvements to the A.I. and enhanced multiplayer experience, the game feels more like an expansion pack than a stand-alone product.",83
1113,213,290,16,"Earned in Blood improves on its predecessor with a larger variety of game modes and a more dynamic A.I., but doesn't deliver enough to warrant it's release as a sequel.

1136,320,1924,17,"A fine, if somewhat simple space-shooter. While space opera certainly requires a suitably pompous storyline, the silly teenage drama is almost too much to bear. While the space combat action plays out great, the missions suffer from the pointless time limits. [Sept 2007]",79

1139,1,1924,17,"Sylpheed gets one thing perfectly right: the intensity of the dogfight. The sheer volume of things on your viewscreen during each sortie is almost overwhelming, but it adds that white-knuckle feeling that's so important to a game like this.",75
1140,158,1924,17,"In short, Project Sylpheed has a solid foundation, but a lot of the game is simply unnecessary.",74
1141,59,1924,17,The control scheme is very confusing and comes with a very tough learning curve. Slowdown at key points in game play was also a reoccurring problem.,73

1153,136,1924,17,"Project Sylpheed is trying to do a bit more than it is capable of – not only due to the occasional graphical slowdown, but also because the gameplay is a bit repetitive and parts of the campaign feel a little rushed or misplaced.",67

Is there anything worse that you can say about a Superman game?",30

Unfortunately, there’s not much I can say is worth the investment for anyone else; outside of a decent multiplayer mode, the game only has a mind-numbingly dull campaign to offer.",40
1216,32,1470,12,"Each entry is an experiment, one that may crash and burn or possibly be an overall improvement. For now, the series would be fine exclusively being RPGs, and I doubt anyone would blame them for playing it safe.",40
1217,5,1470,12,So this is what it looks like if Compile Heart looks at Dynasty Warriors and Monster Hunter and tries to put it into the Gamindustri universe. If it wouldn’t be for the sort of interesting team battles and the nurturing of the characters this would be a total failure.,40

1222,140,1792,12,"Though Oreshika isn't the first to try and make an old-school RPG feel new or to make customizable characters feel like a family affair--Fire Emblem: Awakening tried something similar on a smaller scale, for example--it does feel like the first to completely bet the farm on that idea and succeed.",80
1223,74,1792,12,"The Vita has, much like the PSP before it, become a great home to offbeat JRPG experiences.

The fighting system works great and building up your own clan while having the pressure of time makes it more interesting. Although that time pressure does come with some old-fashioned frustration.,77
1237,41,1792,12,This is a hardcore strategic and time-management RPG that requires you to stick around for the long haul. Players will either feel compelled to do just that or will want to bail after a few generations.,76

1246,233,941,17,"On one side, it represents a powerful elegy, a close to a series that has done much to define this console generation. It's a melancholy thing, seeing a solid conclusion for characters that a lot of us liked despite ourselves, that make themselves even more understood in the end. But Gears of War 3 does it with respect and grace, and even subtlety, for a fantastic experience from start to finish.

In terms of multiplayer, it's obvious that Epic delivers the best episode yet, both in terms of fun and richness.

No game is going to please everyone, but Gears 3 pleased me.",95

It makes some slight changes in the combat mechanics, making them more dynamic, and has great new weapons.

The solid multiplayer, a somewhat meaningful single player experience, an epic score, and the chance to share it with your friends is a compelling package.",91

Small nags you may be left with--like less than stellar dialog or some overpowered attackers in Beast Mode--fall by the wayside as balanced competitive multiplayer, deep Horde Mode mechanics, and a driving campaign win out.

1298,310,569,9,"DiRT 3 is the best part in the DiRT franchise. The game contains a lot of different disciplines and also Gymkhana and that last one works great. The game does look awesome, the audio and soundtrack are great and the gameplay is sublime!",93

1306,413,569,9,"It's got the looks, the style, the superb sense of speed, and spot-on handling model that blurs the line between sim and arcade. It also introduces Gymkhana and with it excellent potential for players becoming addicted to going for new high scores.

Partly because rally racing isn't for everyone, so if you're new, go with a prior game, preferably DiRT 2 and see if the series is for you. Multi-platform owners should get the 360 version. Its controller feels better for racing games, and you can use your Avatar as a prop hanging off of your in-car mirror, which may not make for impressive ad copy, but sure is amusing to see and will get a few laughs out of you.",85

Visually impressive, superb, it offers many game modes, a friendly split-screen multiplayer, the famous Gymkhana events that require dexterity and self-control, direct YouTube videos...

1350,225,569,17,"Dirt 3 has modest game length; the concept over all does not grow tiresome which is great.

1353,108,569,17,"DiRT 3 is the best rally game I've played to date, both in realistic handling and performance and especially in its visual and audio presentation, which can only be described as perfection. A lengthy solo career and some amazingly fun and addictive multiplayer await anyone who dares climb behind the wheel of any of the powerful off-road vehicles you can drive in DiRT 3. No true race fan should miss this game.",94
1354,124,569,17,"DiRT 2 ended up setting the bar for the genre by offering a perfect blend of arcade and simulation paired with an incredible graphics engine and a stylish presentation.

1361,115,569,17,"Dirt 3 is the reliable weekday car that you aren't afraid to take into the mud every once in a while. While it doesn't have the precision or style of some of its high-end peers, Dirt 3 has more than enough personality and moments of exhilaration to make up the difference.",91

1364,226,569,17,"In combining traditional events with those (like Gymkhana) that videogames have not before attempted, DiRT 3 manages to feel both fresh and traditional.

1365,290,569,17,DiRT 3 is one of those rare games that delivers both quality and quantity. Everything is laser-engineered to improve on the brilliant previous game. The only misstep is the anodyne Career mode interface - lots of people will be baffled by the decision to replace the bustling 3D service area with something stylish yet hollow.,90
1366,82,569,17,"Codemasters has succeeded in curating another superlative festival of driving. It's a package more inclusive than any of its predecessors, shot through with the quiet innovations that have defined the studio's more recent efforts. With its off-road events celebrating the series' past and Gymkhana presenting a potentially bright new future, it's another great racing game from an outfit that's proving itself to be a master of its craft.",90
1367,413,569,17,"It's got the looks, the style, the superb sense of speed, and spot-on handling model that blurs the line between sim and arcade. It also introduces Gymkhana and with it excellent potential for players becoming addicted to going for new high scores. What it doesn't do is innovate in the racing game genre, generally making refinements where needed rather than redefining what's expected in a modern racer.",90
1368,262,569,17,"Dirt 3 is a great game, with stunning visuals and a long a various career. But it's an arcade game, not a sim one. Sim addicted are warned.",90
1369,184,569,17,"The racing action is peerless, with Codemasters' racers still clearly in a class of their own. But the style has perhaps swung too far from the Americanised festival atmosphere and it's much more sober as a result. Still absolutely worth your money, mind.",90

1378,393,569,17,"If Codemasters' long-running rally series suffered something of an identity crisis with its transition to the DiRT name, then DiRT 3 has put that crisis to rest. The publisher has found an amorous new bedfellow in Ken Block and successfully built a game around his invigorating style while also managing to retain what made the series great in the first place.",90
1379,160,569,17,"DiRT 3 is the result of the decades of experience developer Codemasters has in the racing genre.

1384,24,569,17,"DiRT 2 sacrificed a lot of its soul in the hunt for a wider, more youthful audience. DiRT 3 has halted this 'fun at the expense of realism' devolution, picks the perfect line between core and arcade, and ends up setting the pace for my favourite driving game of 2011.",90

An improved engine delivers some amazing sceneries and very detailed cars, with state-of-the-art physics and light effects. We apreciated the new features like the Gymkhana mode and the YouTube video upload, while the multiplayer modes proved to be very enteratining and varied.

The rest is a well-balanced mixture of evenly enjoyable race-types, inkluding the tricky Gymkhana events.

1543,207,67,7,"Designed for those who want to enjoy a classic adventure with modern comforts, this game will have a lot of fun for Derceto veterans. Don't expect scares that will take your heart out of your chest, but rather a mystery experience, with gray matter, some smell of gunpowder and pills of Lovecraftian lore.",85
1544,208,67,7,"Alone in the Dark is surprising. It doesn't have the budget to fight the big boys, but through sheer care it manages to punch above its weight. Its biggest detractors reside in its combat, and its biggest strength are just about everywhere else. It's clear to me that the entire production understood the assignment. Even with its missteps the combat design has valuable ideas. The audio and visual designs are a delight. The acting is probably its greatest strength. The writing, led by Soma's Mikael Hedberg, brought lessons learned from both his previous involvements and the legacy of the series to make a more refined story. He also showed, through a nuanced understanding, that Lovecraft's world extends so far beyond tentacles and old-Gods named Cthulhu. It's far from perfect, but it exists, at the bare minimum, as a great starting point for a revitalization of a series that has fallen from influential to forgotten.",85

What Alone in the Dark does do better than its peer is deliver on an engrossing narrative, and an excellent voice cast with Derceto as the main character.

A really great return to form!",80

1554,255,67,7,"Alone in the dark is a wonderful reimagining of the 1992 classic. A survival horror that draws on the best traditions of the genre, which only lacks some variety and spark in its puzzles and combats, as well as homogenizing both parts to reach greater heights. . Both Jodie Comer and David Harbor do a superb job giving voice and face to the protagonists of this horror game inspired by Lovecraft's cosmic horror.",75
1555,146,67,7,"Alone in the Dark presents a promising yet imperfect reimagining that captures the essence of a mesmerising, atmospheric adventure game. However, it struggles to rationalise the inclusion of clunky combat and basic stealth elements that detract from the overall experience…Solid performances support a narrative rich in psychological and cosmic horror, motivating you to delve deeper into the mysteries of Derceto Manor, even though lackluster boss battles weaken the impact of its critical moments. While these action-oriented sections constitute just a fraction of the game, their lackluster implementation impedes the revival effort from achieving its fullest potential and matching the success of other recent survival horror remakes.",70
1556,73,67,7,"Alone in the Dark’s clumsy action and boilerplate occult story may be off-putting to new players hoping for a Resident Evil-like glow-up. Meet the remake on its own terms, though, and you’ll find a charming '90s horror homage that doesn’t turn its nose up at gaming’s roots. It revels in its old-school design like a dedicated cultist, even inviting Hollywood actors to dance around the fire with it.",70
1557,215,67,7,"Alone in the Dark offers a good mix of puzzles, exploration and moments of good tension, but it doesn't really surprise or innovate.",70
1558,358,67,7,"The survival horror genre has leaned more into action these days with greater success overall, such that it’s hard to recommend Alone in the Dark for its combat, which feels updated to modern standards when compared to the original but remains significantly lacking.",70
1559,219,67,7,"Despite a few glitches and a rather classic construction, Alone In The Dark is nonetheless a game that you'll love to play. The game's ambience is clearly present throughout, and the pace of puzzle completion and progression is very well managed.",70
1560,89,67,7,"Ultimately, this return of Alone in the Dark is a project that was only able to convince us halfway. On the one hand there is excellent writing, capable of keeping you glued to the screen for the entire duration of the campaign while, on the other, we find a playful structure that thrives on ups and downs and a shaky technical realization, elements that prevent the title from Pieces and THQ Nordic to take flight. In any case, fans of the genre and admirers of the brand might consider venturing into the gloomy Derceto manor.",70
1561,262,67,7,"Alone in the Dark is undoubtedly an ambitious and researched reinterpretation, a tribute to the original game (and everything that came after) that delivers a new, compelling story, excellent acting performances, an interesting art direction, and nice puzzles but also a pretty sloppy combat design and outdated graphics.",70
1562,247,67,7,"This reboot of Alone in the Dark is mainly driven by its characters and its story, whose particularly meticulous narrative resources immerse us in an intriguing atmosphere and scenario. Fighting and puzzles are unfortunately disappointing, with only a handful of memorable confrontations and a few (too few) devious puzzles. This 2024 version of Alone in the Dark won't become a genre staple, but it will keep survival-horror fans busy until the release of the Silent Hill 2 remake.",70

1564,224,67,7,"A lack of horror behind the captivating puzzle adventure. While exploring the Derceto Manor is consistently enjoyable, it is really hard to catch the sense of fear which is crucial to a horror game. Still, it might serve as a nostalgic journey for those who remember the original.",70
1565,397,67,7,"When I first played this year’s Alone in the Dark re-imagining, I thought it was a very good but flawed experience. After this week’s massive update, I’m glad I waited a bit longer to do my review because it is now in a much better state, and is worth your time even if you never played the original. Just be aware of the visual cutbacks needed to get this running on Steam Deck. I liked it enough to get it on PS5 for a replay.",70
1566,231,67,7,"An old-fashioned Lovecraftian action-adventure game rather than frenetic Survival Horror, Alone in the Dark allows itself an interesting re-imagining of the founding episodes. Nostalgia unfortunately collides with obsolescence: even the hardcore fan of the license will have difficulty getting past systems that are too archaic. We would have appreciated that, freed from the chains of AAA with huge budgets and the need to necessarily do better than its competitors, the Pieces Interactive title tried more things, did things differently, allowed itself a certain radicality. It is not so. An adventure with a capital “AA”, imperfect in its substance as in its form, but sincere in everything it undertakes.",65
1567,138,67,7,"Alone in the Dark (2024) developers decided to run away and jump into the rich Survival Horror genre, without having any trump cards at the ready. That’s exactly what the authors of the new Alone in the Dark decided to do. The mystical plot of evil in the Louisiana swamps quickly turns into a disjointed kaleidoscope, where characters and any semblance of integrity are lost. The game system turned out to be obscenely poor: four types of weapons, five types of enemies, two types of puzzles!

Though the game itself and the environments can be beautiful, it doesn't take advantage of its star-studded cast nor does it tell a story that is remotely sensical or engaging. Always offering just the bare minimum of staples for the survival horror genre and nothing more, it's sad to see the grand daddy of the genre be a shell of its former self. Maybe Alone in the Dark should remain exactly like its namesake.",55
1574,103,67,7,"The game certainly gets better as time goes on, and the story is well-told enough that it's worth experiencing for survival horror fans. However, it comes with the caveats that the overall gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, and its survival horror contemporaries just do a better job on nearly every front.",50
1575,305,67,7,Alone in the Dark is a weak survival horror pastiche largely devoid of original moments. The occasional dash of character in its 1920s Deep South setting can't make up for repetitive puzzles and the feeling we've seen all of this before.,50

1585,74,67,11,"It’s really nice to have Alone in the Dark back in form. And for it to have its own identity. After being such a pioneer, this series has spent so long chasing the horror genre popular trends and trying to read the lowest common denominator that it became little more than a pale imitation of other good ideas. It’s genuinely nice to have something that heads in its own direction, and is comfortable in providing a taut atmosphere and a focus on a chilling narrative rather than visceral scares. You could call it “quaint,” but I like to think of it more like a game Stephen King would like to see rather than another cash-in from the Saw writers.",90
1586,315,67,11,"Alone in the Dark may not be the most inventive game of its kind, but it is extremely competent in everything it proposes. Combat, exploration and narrative are excellent, with a beautiful noir setting, slipping in few visual details and rhythm. The original survivor horror is back, and in a big way.",85
1587,37,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is an impressive reimagining that successfully revitalizes the franchise. Instead of leaning into the action elements that have become more prevalent in the genre, Pieces Interactive respects its DNA by opting to focus on the puzzle aspect of the adventure. As a result, the game carves its own niche which will lure fans of the genre. Although the action segments feel a little rigid and dated, the conundrums are well thought out and a highlight of the experience which helps to make this a must for horror addicts.",84
1588,258,67,11,"Alone in the Dark brings back that survival horror feeling with a fresh new look and honors the classic 1992 game that was one of the inspirations for so many others, like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The gameplay with two main characters is pretty enjoyable, the puzzles are challenging and combat is fun. It could have better visuals and optimization, but it's a good experience for those that like the genre.",81
1589,69,67,11,"Those looking for a third-person action shooter may lose patience with Alone in the Dark. However, those looking for a traditional survival horror experience, one with its PS1 roots still slightly visible, might be reminded why they fell in love with the genre to begin with. The main takeaway though, is that Alone in the Dark is finally back, playing to its strengths, and catering to those who've missed it.",80
1590,100,67,11,"Alone in the Dark scores with its intense atmosphere, exciting story and overall good puzzle design. There are deductions for the sluggish controls, the average fights and the backdrop-like game world. Overall, however, THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive offer you a gripping and balanced action adventure with survival horror elements.",80
1591,218,67,11,"Even if this reinterpretation of Alone in the Dark occasionally stumbles a little in technical terms, you can feel the love for the original and the horror genre in every fibre of the game. It's a great conundrum of mysterious characters, supernatural forces and classic gothic horror.",80
1592,85,67,11,"What has been added or upgraded in the new Alone in the Dark is not only a match for the ideas from 1992, but actually something better, creating a deeper, richer and more interesting game. Some of the changes, however, are so far-reaching that it's not really a remake, but a completely new game.",80
1593,351,67,11,"The game is quite short and doesn't outstay its welcome. We finished our first playthough in nine hours, and it left us wanting more. And in the age where some big games can feel really bloated with busy work, that was actually really refreshing...A few story threads are left dangling at the end, so here’s hoping Alone in the Dark does well enough to spawn some spooky sequels in a similar mould. We’d certainly come back for a return visit.",80
1594,61,67,11,Well worth a look if you’re seeking the comfort of nostalgia with some quality acting talent.,80
1595,188,67,11,"It’s such a great time to be a horror game fan and I feel going into Alone in the Dark with an open mind will help for a much more enjoyable experience. I think Jodie Comer and David Harbour did a great job in their respective roles and would love to see more content in the future. We have an IP that inspired so many games into a genre all its own and now it’s time for the master to become the student as it’s learned so much from other staples in horror like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and The Suffering for some examples. Alone in the Dark doesn’t try to mimic any of these games by inspiring them to pay respect to what fans love.",80
1596,413,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a considerate reimagining of a pioneering classic, weaving together nifty puzzles, edge-of-your-sofa combat, and clever scares.",80
1597,221,67,11,"After several installments that have failed to do justice to the Infogrames classic, Alone in the Dark returns in a new episode somewhere between a reboot and a remake. An original story with an all-star cast that modernizes the classic and offers a new starting point for this mix of Lovecraft and intelligent humor.",80
1598,70,67,11,"Alone in the Dark‘s revival has been a long time coming. And while this new take on the mysteries of Derceto Manor carry a decades-long weight of survival horror innovation, Pieces Interactive almost missed the mark. Barring underwhelming combat and a lack of polish, curious players will be met with an expertly acted, unnerving tale of madness that just might be the spark Alone in the Dark needs to reemerge from the shadows.",79
1599,154,67,11,"The new Alone in the Dark is just the right game for fans of games full of suspense, who are tired of annoying jump-scares. So if you value the captivating atmosphere over adrenaline surges in similar titles, you will really enjoy this reboot.",75
1600,192,67,11,"While this modern take on the beloved classic is certainly beautiful to look at in places, it stumbles a bit with ill-advised combat and an uneven presentation. Still, the lore drops are incredible, the performances solid, and the Lovecraftian storyline is intriguing - and when it goes hard at the end, it is a sight to behold. Survival horror fans won't find huge scares here, but there is a fun feeling of creeping dread and anticipation that moves things along.",75
1601,76,67,11,"A stunningly designed game and a delight to explore with a fantastic cast and puzzles galore, although it can suffer from the occasional framerate issues and fewer monsters than I had hoped. Reviewed on PS5.",75
1602,22,67,11,"I would not recommend making your purchase instantly, because in its first days it costs $60 USD, and the truth is, it is not worth it no matter how much it has decent elements. If you want to try Alone in The Dark, I suggest waiting for a discount after a few months or just being patient in case by some miracle they add it to Game Pass.",75
1603,382,67,11,"I was pleasantly surprised, especially given the series’ ignoble history to this point, to find 2024’s Alone in the Dark is actually really enjoyable. While not the most polished or visually impressive game, it’s a charming one that goes out of its way to pay tribute to the original trilogy with its survival horror elements and shameless lore dumps. An effectively spooky presentation, violent enemies, and clever puzzles round out the package, making this the first Alone in the Dark game since the 1990s to be an Alone in the Dark game.",75
1604,133,67,11,An atmospheric detective thriller with a great setting that gets in its own way during the action.,75
1605,365,67,11,"Due to the clumsy and imprecise combat system, as well as the outdated graphics, Alone in the Dark fails to relaunch the series among the big franchises of the survival horror genre.",72
1606,40,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a good game, typical of 90s horror experiences. We find the intention of the original game from 1992, with a particularly careful atmosphere, a gripping story and good old-fashioned puzzles, even if we find the same mechanics quite a few times. Too bad the fights aren't enjoyable to play, that's the big negative point of the game, much more boring than certain dated aspects. In short, Alone in the Dark 2024 is a good old-fashioned horror game, with a lot of charm, which manages to seduce even if it does not live up to the original. At the same time, it's difficult to hit the mark for a horror game in a world where Resident Evil 4 Remake or Alan Wake 2 already exist.",70
1607,34,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a mid-tier title that successfully blends together elements of survival horror and adventure games, dripping with atmosphere but full of discouraging bugs. If you’re able to turn a blind eye to the noticeably limited development budget of this reboot, it can be really enjoyable.",70
1608,35,67,11,"Alone in the Dark 2024 revitalizes a classic franchise with a compelling setting and exploration focus, despite being marred by bugs and lacklustre combat.",70
1609,195,67,11,Alone in the Dark plays more of a moody psychological thriller with a heavy emphasis on puzzles rather than a traditional survival horror experience. That combined with the plethora of technical issues hold another remake of an original masterpiece back from reaching its true heights.,70
1610,200,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a faithful take on the original, with some smart puzzles and a charming Southern tone despite some frustrating combat.",70
1611,283,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is the best thing that has happened to this series in a very long time. It presents this supernatural and strange narrative in a modern light that doesn't overshadow the campy and over-the-top presentation of the original. Still, I feel like the developers are playing it safe here with the gameplay systems, including the underutilized dual protagonist concept. Regardless, the low barrier of entry ensures that anyone playing feels immersed in this world, and a sequel can build on the excellent foundation of this revival.",70
1612,359,67,11,"While this revisit to the Derceto Manor can be a bit jank at times, it captures a genuinely macabre, unsettling, and investigative narrative that Alone in the Dark has long been missing.",70
1613,421,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is the best entry in the franchise in over two decades, although there wasn’t much competition for that title. So-so combat, technical issues, and a frustrating lack of consistency sometimes cast a shadow over the game, and yet, there’s still something enticing here. The game’s intricately-designed Derceto Manor hub, thick Lovecraftian atmosphere, and surprisingly-varied level design ought to be enough to light a spark of enthusiasm in some hardcore survival horror fans’ dark hearts.",70
1614,418,67,11,"Alone in the Dark has several problems, but I still had fun playing it. However, a classic that practically established the way survival horror is today deserved a remake done with more caution and care.",70
1615,101,67,11,"Alone In The Dark may not be the shiniest or glossiest game available right now. It doesn’t boast cutting-edge graphics, but, I urge you not to be put off by how a game looks. Sure, I’d be surprised if Alone in the Dark is a game of the year contender (though I think its sound design and acting are worth a shout for a nomination) but if you love old-school horror games, then Alone in the Dark could be your surprise contender for 2024. Despite some flaws, it wholeheartedly gets my seal of approval.",70
1616,248,67,11,"Despite its issues, Alone in the Dark is interesting enough to be worth completing. While much of the story overlaps between Emily and Edward, there are a couple of unique sections for each, and apparently if you uncover all of the hidden items there’s a secret ending available. With that in mind, Alone in the Dark can be completed in around 5 hours the first time and about half that for subsequent playthroughs because the puzzles don’t change depending on which main character you select.",70
1617,329,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a success in more ways than it's not. There are notable issues preventing it from reaching that upper echelon but nonetheless developer Pieces Interactive has crafted an engaging experience with enough charm that fans of the series, or indeed the genre, will no doubt lap up.",70

1619,139,67,11,"Alone in the Dark isn’t flawless, but it’s definitely one of the best entries in the series so far and an accomplished reimagining. Its story will keep you on your toes, even if sometimes you might feel like it could have a little more fleshed out. And while the game’s combat doesn’t impress, the oppressive atmosphere throughout is effective at keeping you on edge. Throw in a bucketload of enjoyable puzzles to overcome, and you have a survival horror that’s well worth spending some time with.",70
1620,379,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is, unfortunately, a missed opportunity. Despite an absolutely fascinating aesthetic and artistic structure, the game encounters terrible technical problems, so much so that it affects the performance of the game itself in terms of gameplay mechanics.",70
1621,129,67,11,"Alone in the Dark doesn't try to offer anything more than a typical survival horror experience. However, this turns out to be part of its charm, providing more or less a nostalgic experience that would make any fan of the genre to reminisce about the golden, PS2 era of survival horrors.",70
1622,176,67,11,"Alone in the Dark fulfills the proposal of offering us a reinvention of the classic 1992 game in a more decent way. The best thing about the game is the exploration and investigation, the possibility of playing two campaigns with different points of view is amazing. The shooting is not a big deal since the enemies are not difficult and we don't have new weapons or upgrades.",70
1623,327,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a surprisingly competent effort that looks back at its own legacy more than towards where the genre has gone. There's less of a focus on combat and survival with the mystery of Derceto taking up the majority of my attention. The performances from Comer and Harbour add some gravitas to a tale that can occasionally stray into theatrics but there's a solid sense of atmosphere and good foundation for whatever comes next. I do wonder about longevity with the two campaigns sadly mirroring one another. Combat, whilst not front and centre, does seem to lack menace. I'd still recommend it, for anyone curious.",70
1624,362,67,11,"Alone in the Dark checks all the boxes when it comes to gameplay elements you would expect in a modern survival horror, but these seem to be stuck in the past. It feels like a project made with passion but enough budget to hit the AAA expectations. The archaic mechanics do not involve a pleasant nostalgia, rather make the entire game feel outdated. Overall, it is not a bad game, but it does not have enough oomph to make it compete with the best games out there, let alone reconquer the throne of the genre. With a hefty discount it can become an interesting choice for the fans of the genre, a period that should also give time to the developers to fix the bugs that are still present.",70
1625,308,67,11,Alone in the Dark remakes the original in all the elementary ways that were perfected a long time ago.

1628,216,67,11,"Alone in the Dark leaves a lot to be desired compared to other survival horror games, but it manages to deliver a somewhat competent experience. The game doesn't really shine in any aspect, but has small positives and is a good return for a franchise that needed a restart to position itself among the genre it created many years ago. Alone in the Dark is not dead, and if it manages to fix mistakes it can have a bright future ahead.",65
1629,326,67,11,"The adapted story is very engaging to follow which is complemented by clever level design and good exploration gameplay. At the same time, it is not the remake it could have been, as battles lack precision, the actors lack empathy and the technical side is also far from perfect. At its core, it is an interesting title, but these shortcomings definitely do the game no favors and that is a shame.",65
1630,231,67,11,"An old-fashioned Lovecraftian action-adventure game rather than frenetic Survival Horror, Alone in the Dark allows itself an interesting re-imagining of the founding episodes. Nostalgia unfortunately collides with obsolescence: even the hardcore fan of the license will have difficulty getting past systems that are too archaic. We would have appreciated that, freed from the chains of AAA with huge budgets and the need to necessarily do better than its competitors, the Pieces Interactive title tried more things, did things differently, allowed itself a certain radicality. It is not so. An adventure with a capital “AA”, imperfect in its substance as in its form, but sincere in everything it undertakes.",65

1632,27,67,11,"Alone in the Dark is a collective of issues and fails to impress or add anything to the genre. It is hard to revive the beloved series, but the previous attempts and the final package here all signal that Alone in the Dark should remain a nostalgia.",60
1633,251,67,11,"Alone In The Dark aims to reimagine the classic 1992 game but falls short in creating an atmosphere worthy of a pioneering franchise in the survival horror genre. Despite being accompanied by good music and decent performances, it is a title with significant shortcomings in its overall pace, moderately acceptable puzzles, and a poor combat system. It seeks to evoke the purest Lovecraftian essence but fails to execute this idea with the expected success, which is disappointing for such a beloved series that fails to release games up to par.",60
1634,198,67,19,"Alone in the dark is a fairly balanced return of an iconic franchise with a lot of influence in the industry. This reinvention is successful and allows us to glimpse an interesting story, which offers us a new opportunity to understand the mysteries of the Derceto mansion.",85
1635,437,67,19,"Overall, I’ve had a decent time with Alone in the Dark. The Resident Evil reboots are a clear and massive inspiration, and while it might not be quite on their level, Alone in the Dark still manages to entertain with a weird and wonderful experience. The combat sections are definitely a weak spot, but the exploration and puzzle parts are able to balance this out nicely.",83
1636,357,67,19,"The new Alone in the Dark game is nicely slow and the action is only secondary. There are a lot of puzzles and you have to read journals, notes and clues to solve them. You'll enjoy the atmosphere, the intelligently written story, the two well-crafted perspectives, the great music, and the puzzles. Want to shoot zombies in the head and not strain yours? Find something else.",80

1638,225,67,19,"Alone in the Dark is the best game in the series in decades. After several failed attempts at a reboot and one awful cash grab, Pieces Interactive’s take on the venerable survival horror successfully fuses old and new design philosophies, respecting Frédérick Raynal’s original vision while adding plenty of fresh ideas of its own. It’s not without its issues, but if you’re looking for a game that actually knows the definition of Lovecraftian, a slow burn that is more chilling, the more you think about it. You might want to spend some time Alone in the Dark.",80
1639,363,67,19,"This reimagination of a classic nails the tone, the cast and the mix of puzzle, exploration and action. It has its weaknesses, but Pieces Interactive has managed to create a horror game that should be able to relive this iconic franchise.",76
1640,440,67,19,"If you’re a survival horror fan, you should check out Alone in the Dark. Although it’s a bit dated and a bit flawed, it remains a rather solid game; so much so that I enjoyed beating it twice within one week. Don’t play it for the combat, but do so for the story, sound and settings. It’s worth checking out for sure.",76
1641,427,67,19,"Alone in the Dark is a perfectly fun survival-horror game that doesn't manage to stick the landing. Fun puzzle-solving struggles with awkward combat, and a lack of tension keeps the horror feeling limited. It's an interesting reboot of the franchise, and I could easily see it becoming something better in sequels, but the first outing feels unexceptional.",75

1643,120,67,19,"The combat may be janky and the puzzles are nothing special, but anyone looking for a truly satisfying horror story need look no further. If nothing else, it knows how to end in a great way, and that in itself is worth a lot.",75
1644,174,67,19,"If you’re a fan of old-school survival horror games, definitely give this game a try. I greatly enjoyed it and could look past the flaws, but the flaws are too bad to ignore (in some instances) when reviewing the game. Alone in the Dark is a series that has been MUCH in need of a reboot and reimagining and this latest Alone in the Dark does that quite well. This game may have its problems, but it’s certainly nice to see that Alone in the Dark is actually relevant once again.",75
1645,448,67,19,Alone in the Dark was a fun adventure that scratched an itch I always have. It is a solid survival horror game that sometimes suffers under the weight of its own technical shortcomings.,70

However, the game really nails the tone, and it is just a joy to explore Derceto and drink in the spooky vibes of this Lovecraftian detective thriller. There’s enough twists and turns to have you hanging on until the end, even if the latter half of the game feels a little too reliant on action that isn’t quite up to snuff.",70
1647,340,67,19,"Alone In The Dark is an ambitious reimagining that does little to differentiate itself from the games it's inspired by. While it's clearly taking inspiration from both Resident Evil and The Evil Within to be a survival horror powerhouse, the flat feeling combat and timid horror elements stop it from standing above the games that inspired it. Despite this, a unique take on the story and the strong setting makes it well worth a look for horror fans.",70

THQ Nordic's revival isn't a bad game — we enjoyed chunks of it especially towards the beginning of the adventure — but it doesn't stand out in any meaningful way, and ultimately feels a little pointless in the end. We'd recommend keeping an eye on that launch patch to see how the game is shaping up on release, but it's best not to expect a Resident Evil-level reimagining from this Alone in the Dark reboot - even if it stands as a serviceable third-person adventure.",60

This is not a casual game by any stretch of the imagination, and given how complex many of the mechanics are, it’s pretty ridiculous that the game doesn’t offer a more robust tutorial system.

1788,142,691,13,"A pretty fun game. And with a 15- to 20-hour main quest that you can play through with three different characters (and again in co-op play), you'll definitely get your money's worth.",70
1789,446,691,13,"No, it doesn't have the depth of its PC granddaddy, but barring a handful of unfortunate issues, it's perfectly good at what it does: pass the time.",70

1796,82,691,13,"Dungeon Siege starts out exceptionally well but really does fail to build in its promising foundations as the game progresses, and this lack of development means that as you approach the eight hour mark (the whole game works out at somewhere between 12 and 15 hours), you'll really feel like you've seen everything on offer.",70

1894,124,1937,17,The original Puzzle Quest set the bar so high for Galactrix it is almost unfair to compare the two but in the end you must. If you can get past the “dumbed” down gameplay this is actually a fun and lengthy worthwhile gaming experience which most puzzle fans and Role Playing Gamers will enjoy.

1905,78,1937,17,"While the overall blandness means Galactrix is unlikely to truly thrill many people, it also means that it won’t exclude anyone either, and the ever-reliable pattern-spotting blends with the steady trickle of meaningless rewards to exert a pull on its audience that is truly Pavlovian.

1906,82,1937,17,"A dilution, not a distillation of Puzzle Quest's relentlessly compelling formula. It's a game that drives the franchise too deep into niche territory, where it loses sight of the elegance and simplicity which turned the match-three genre into an everyman phenomenon.",70
1907,52,1937,17,"Galactrix does have a decent game underneath the Sci-Fi veneer, and actually the introduction of some new themes and tactics into the puzzles has been done well. However, the implementation fails to live up to the original and never really feels as satisfying to play.",70

It features a world with so much depth, a story which twists and turns in meaningful ways, and clever tweaks to the combat that make the turn-based battles fun.

It improves on its predecessor in nearly every way, shakes things up enough to still be exciting for players who may have recently poured sixty hours into the first game, and offers a meaningful chance to reconnect with beloved characters.

2002,279,279,1,"The mixture of old and new characters, locations and ideas works quite well, though the feeling remains that more could have been done to the world as a whole. That doesn't mean that you won't be charmed by most of what the game offers, because faces like Yew's or Magnolia's are hard to ignore. It helps that it moves along at a solid pace and the battle system is still a joy to behold.",85
2003,430,279,1,"Bravely Second manages to stay fresh and interesting, even if it seems to go on forever. The graphics and voice acting are great for a 3DS game. You definitely get your money's worth and any fan of Japanese RPGs should give this game a try.",85
2004,365,279,1,"It doesn’t turn the original formula upside down (obviously, since it worked so well), and it could have been way better from a narrative standpoint with more courage, and yet Bravely Second is still and amazing JRPG, and a must buy for anyone who liked the first chapter in the series.",85

2008,77,279,1,"If, deep in your soul, you love optimizing characters, power-gaming, and creating incredibly broken move combos while still being challenged by enemies, then Bravely Second provides the perfect playground.

2017,54,279,1,"Bravely Second is one of the few JRPGs to play purely for the gameplay. While the story is good, the writing tends to spoil one too many potentially great moments with unnecessary fluff and comedic skits.

The game also lacks hints for the puzzles which often only allow the one solution that even is the most digressive. The player doesn’t get sufficient feedback while trying to solve the puzzles, whatever there are from hints or out of dialogues with other characters.

The game is far from the Metroidvania style but in exchange offers many hours of intense combat, and a story that studies in the Belmont family mythology.

2157,277,357,1,"Although the 2D perspective and Metroidvania-style features call to mind past classics, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate shouldn’t be directly compared to previous games in Konami’s long-running vampire-hunting series, because it tries to do things a little differently.",80
2158,334,357,1,"A huge thrill-a-minute adventure, with satisfying combat, and big boss fights. Just don't expect the old Metroidvania formula.",80
2159,148,357,1,"Mercury Steam continues to demonstrate its talent in this new contribution to its Lords of Shadow reboot of the Castlevania series. Beautifully transposed to 2,5D gameplay, this 3DS title brings back together demanding platforming and deep combat mechanics, in an accessible mix that only lacks a little more puzzles and, for old-timers, challenge.",80
2160,87,357,1,"As Lords of Shadow, Mirror of Fate stands out not only for its massive amount of content, but also for some well polished gameplay mechanics, like it's great combat system.",80
2161,37,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is as enjoyable reboot, if you will, to an age-old franchise. The game has all the right elements to make it fun and enjoyable. Sure, it has a few issues but fans of the series, and genre as a whole, will most likely love it even if it does bristle with the liberties in the storyline. That being said, the casual fan may have trouble with the sometimes-tough control and dark undertones of the subject material.",80
2162,337,357,1,"Like Bram Stoker’s famous book Dracula, the source material on which the series is based, Castlevania continues to evolve and reinvent itself for new audiences.",80
2163,374,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is an excellent entry into this new Castlevania canon. It treats its plot with as much reverence as a home console title, while capturing more of the feel of classic Castlevania than Lords of Shadow. It's an excellent companion piece to Gabriel's first adventure, and a thoughtful, well-designed handheld title in particular.",80
2164,230,357,1,"If you liked Castlevania: Lords of Shadows, you'll like Mirror of Fate. Mercury Steam succeed in combining the basis of Konami's reboot and some old stuffs from the early episodes. The result is ten hours of an intense and gripping adventure that will lead you to the end of Dracula's reign. The choice between four characters is very welcome, exactly like the renewal in the gameplay. A successful bet.",80
2165,86,357,1,Mirror of Fate is almost a unique offer and that is what is essential when you immerse yourself in this crossed destiny of four characters.,80
2166,186,357,1,"Overall, this is a game that will likely divide Castlevania fans. Taken on its own merit we can only recommend this to 3DS owners. It’s a dark and forbidding fairy tale told with skill and it conjures an atmospheric adventure which leads into the darker, more brutal side of the Castlevania universe.",80
2167,5,357,1,"The dynamic battles are well executed, the 3D-effects strike you with immense feeling of depth. But Mercury Steam can’t get a grip on the spirit of past mobile Castlevanias. This plays more like a two-dimensional God of War than a modern variation of the cult vampire saga.",77
2168,365,357,1,"The new direction Castlevania has taken can be liked or not, and we personally fall into the latter category, but Mirror of Fate is nonetheless a very good, albeit not perfect, action game for 3DS. If only it was devoid of that tedious quick time events.",75
2169,54,357,1,"If fans come in expecting something more like Castlevania IV than Symphony of the Night, they're in for a good experience. More than anything though, Mirror of Fate has me excited for Lords of Shadow 2.",75
2170,228,357,1,"Mirror of Fate doesn’t do much terribly wrong, but doesn’t do much greatly either. All parts are subjected to a story that doesn’t live up to standards. It’s party Lords of Shadow with a deep, perfectly integrated combat system that hardly gets put to the test. It’s partly Metroidvania, but exploration doesn’t have a great impact due to lackluster upgrades. When holding Mirror of Fate up to a mirror, it mostly misses a clear execution of a number of good ideas.",75
2171,430,357,1,"The game looks great and the gameplay is fantastic, but it never becomes too hard. The storyline that was so great in the original is not that clear in this game.",75
2172,82,357,1,"While Mirror of Fate might willingly fumble the classic structure somewhat, it's still got a touch of that familiar vampire-hunting charm to it - a charm that comes to the rescue whenever the developer's invention or polish fall short.",70
2173,78,357,1,"Three times the protagonists gives you three times the number of toys and an engaging, if thoroughly convoluted, story, but it’s not without cost. What Simon, Trevor and Alucard give to the mechanics and narrative they take from its flow: you still feel gated, even when you’ve got all the gear.",70
2174,204,357,1,"Much like its title, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow — Mirror of Fate plays with multiple concepts attempting to garner widespread appeal, but would be better suited focusing on just one.",70
2175,380,357,1,"Purists will be pleased, then, with Mirror of Fate for the Nintendo 3DS. Although excessively subtitled, it’s a return to the series’ two-dimensional side-scrolling roots, which is both a good and a bad thing. While the exploration and clever puzzle-solving is front and centre again, so too is an unfortunate side effect – a healthy dose of backtracking.",70
2176,84,357,1,"With Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate MercurySteams follows its own way of thinking about the epic Konami franchise. The developers did a good job in capturing Castlevania’s soul, but the game’s soundtrack and level design aren’t good enough to stand a chance against the other portable episodes of the series. It’s still a good and entertaining game, anyway.",70
2177,140,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is a fun and occasionally challenging action game with successful elements and an unfortunate, but small, selection of poor design choices.",70
2178,259,357,1,"These complaints ultimately make Castlevania: Lords of Shadow- Mirror of Fate disposable and just short of being considered a classic, but so long as you except the game for what it is, you'll most likely have a zombie-whipping good time.",70
2179,220,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is not your typical handheld Castlevania adventure: with a more predictable map exploration and a weapon and magic variety reduced to its lowest terms, it sets itself as a portable version of the Lords of Shadow saga. Mercury Steam has put some distance between what Konami and Igarashi achieved in the past ten+ years: this is a somewhat good action/fighting game, but a less-then-stellar Castlevania experience, plagued by a questionable frame rate.",70
2180,157,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is basically a 2D God of War, so if you dig platformers with decent combat mechanics, you’ll most likely enjoy it.",70
2181,160,357,1,"Mirror of Fate is a good game. Take Lords of Shadow, cut the playing time in half, limit the third dimension to an optical illusion and what remains is an action adventure game that plays like a dream. The only real concession that was made is a story that hardly adds anything, which makes this feel more like a spin-off. That's a shame, because it was supposed to be the link between Lords of Shadow and LoS 2.",70
2182,89,357,1,"Castlevania Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate is an average action game, far from the feeling of its predecessor.",70
2183,171,357,1,"The Nintendo 3DS seems to be struggling of fully perform all of the great ideas of the latest Castlevania adventure. Still, this is highly recommended for all fans of the series.",70
2184,88,357,1,"The game holds me down with its vampire-like claws from the start and all the way until the end when the credits roll. But it never manages to sink its teeth into me and fully win me over to the other side. Afterwards, I break free without any trouble and wander out into the sunlight, while leaving the game in the darkness as I get ready for my next adventure with something else.",70
2185,233,357,1,"There's nothing inherently wrong with linearity here; Mirror of Fate is just lacking an easily discernible big picture, and often conflates errand-running for intricacy. It's also unevenly paced, with all the solid puzzles sedimenting in the game's middle.",70
2186,55,357,1,"In trying to distance itself a little bit from the formula that 2D Metroidvanias have now stuck to for the past 15 years, Mirror of Fate succeeded in most areas but falls a little bit too short in others.",70
2187,129,357,1,"Τranslating Lords of Shadow into a side-scrolling experience with Mirror of Fate was a successful experiment, though its shortcomings in some areas prevent it from achieving perfection. Even so, it's definitely worth playing.",70
2188,120,357,1,"Although Mirror of Fate doesn't live up to its full potential, it often comes close. I can see the beginnings of a fantastic new-school Castlevania experience trying hard to emerge here, and with just a little more polish and precision, MercurySteam would have turned out a solid winner. It's not yet fully evolved, but the work done here is still a valid step towards the future state of this ever-changing series.",70
2189,389,357,1,"All things considered, Mirror of Fate is still a decent game, one that is merely injured by some elements of poor design. It’s a unique approach to rebooting a franchise, one that doesn’t seek to reestablish the rules, but instead utilize them as a guide, thus allowing this new version to travel its own direction.",70
2190,58,357,1,"Castlevania: Mirror of Fate is stupid in a good way and robust enough to be an enjoyable challenge. While the boss battles go on a bit too long and the plot is bonkers, it’s a good use of a platforming style often forgotten.",70

2193,325,1285,17,"A prodigiously enjoyable title. It has lots of action, violence, crazed humour and simple gameplay for pick up and play moments. It might be too easy and the multiplayer mode is not the best, but apart from those two minute annoyances there is nothing else you can fault it on.",94

2208,320,1285,17,A hilarious parody of Star Wars. The main problem is the camera in the co-op-game. The camera angle should be wider or it should pan more in the flying missions. [Sept 2006],83

2682,452,2108,2,"The control system is fine, and it works particularly well with the DS stylus. [Issue#22, p.87]",70
2683,242,2108,2,"As far as point-and-click adventures go, this is an decent title. Unfortunately the plot never manages to raise any interest. Graphics and controls do their job just fine, but if you've played the PC-version there is nothing new to be found here. This is mainly recommended for fans of the genre who haven't played the version for the PC.",60
2684,84,2108,6,"A porting that could be made with more care in terms of gameplay and graphics, despite this the game manages to still be fun.",80
2685,365,2108,6,An acceptable remastered of a title that needed something more to be appealing to nowadays players.,60
2686,323,516,14,"Smart, unothordox, creepy as hell. I can’t recommend Deadly Creatures enough. One of the rare few third-party Wii games you should be proud to add to your collection.",95
2687,108,516,14,This is a title Wii owners deserve and every other game studio should aspire to match.,93
2688,142,516,14,"Ultimately, the clever level design and variety of traversal techniques (burrowing, web-grappling and wall-crawling) present both a great challenge and a nice diversity in activities that held my interest and kept me playing much longer than I probably expected to. Despite its frightening, creepy-crawly protagonists, I found Deadly Creatures to be both charming and endearing.",90
2689,449,516,14,Overall this is a very enjoyable game. It is fun on its own as an arachnid and arthropod themed adventure game but is boosted with an extra story featuring recognizable and excellent voice acting.,90
2690,408,516,14,"Hands down, Deadly Creatures if one of the most original and entertaining offerings of the console portfolio and, not only that, is one of the most ambitious project regarding immersion, both in gameplay as in the atmosphere achieved.",86
2691,147,516,14,Deadly Creatures should renew your interest in your Nintendo Wii if you’ve had a falling out recently with the lack of titles to play. It’s fun for all ages and packs a thrilling rollercoaster of a ride till you finally complete the storyline.,86
2692,21,516,14,"If you’re looking for a refreshing respite from the Wii’s line-up of me-too mini-game collections and other familiar fare, you should let Deadly Creatures infest your game library.",85
2693,192,516,14,"Deadly Creatures is one of those cool, quirky games that you miss the first time around.",83
2694,285,516,14,A very pleasant surprise and one of the finest mature games on the Wii. Confront your fears and pick this one up.,81
2695,184,516,14,"Deadly Creatures isn’t quite spectacular, but it is a solid experience that never runs out of ideas and will keep throwing in surprises, satisfying combat, and a decent challenge.",80
2696,213,516,14,"This is a game for Wii owners who want something refreshingly different. It's powered by a dark, intelligent storyline, boasts great production values through and through, and features smart, fun controls (that use the Wii remote well), not to mention some unexpectedly engrossing exploration elements.",80
2697,123,516,14,"The motion controls needed tweaking and it's sad that the game lacks multiplayer. In the end, however, these Creatures will send shivers down your spine and put a smile on your face.",80
2698,4,516,14,"Without anyone noticing, a scorpion and a tarantula burst onto the videogame market with a long and enjoyable title not suitable for claustrophobic gamers but very recommended for people looking for a natural and realistic creatures experience on Wii.",80
2699,239,516,14,"If you are a Wii gamer, don't miss Deadly Creatures.",80
2700,160,516,14,"Deadly Creatures turned out to be a very good game, because of its originality, scary looks and outstanding gameplay. Getting into the life of a scorpion or a tarantula was a very interesting experience, that no Wii-gamer should miss out on. The few flaws and short duration prevent the game from getting a high rating, but won't stop us from wanting a second part.",80
2701,152,516,14,It’s exciting to see something that is simultaneously comfortably old school yet refreshingly new school hit our Wii screens.,80
2702,262,516,14,"Deadly Creatures is a good game that could have been great with a better control system and a less conventional gameplay. However, Wii owners should definitely give it a try.",79
2703,280,516,14,"Exploration elements provide awe, as well as a video and audio presentation that push the system to its fullest. A living, breathing world awaits, but the camera hiccups really do stutter the experience.",79
2704,195,516,14,"I hope that this isn't the last Deadly Creatures game we see. The concept is really great, and a lot of times, this game feels like it's laying the groundwork for a pretty cool franchise.",79
2705,278,516,14,"An action-adventure that's unlike anything else out there. Fortunately, there's more to it than just a good concept; the game is eerie and atmospheric, and its unique tarantula and scorpion protagonists stand out from the usual heroes. [Mar 2009, p.89]",75
2706,140,516,14,"There is nothing like Deadly Creatures. The stars of this game are completely vile, and there is nothing done to make them the slightest bit endearing. However, despite presenting an unsettling world, this well-made game provides plenty of hair-raising moments and memorable duels.",75
2707,136,516,14,"Still, even with the short playing time, it's hard not to recommend Deadly Creatures. The level design is top notch, the animations of the various bugs are downright creepy and the combat is oddly satisfying. The game also hosts some interesting boss battles which take into account the fact that the bosses are usually much, much bigger than you, meaning that the best way to win is to simply survive.",75
2708,365,516,14,"If only Deadly Creatures could've been e little bit lengthier and varied, we would recommend it to every Wii owner eager to try a new experience. The experiment is successful, but it lacks any kind of re-playability, and it won't last long. Still, it's nice to see that new ideas do come up even in this next-gen, and they should be rewarded with a good try.",75
2709,228,516,14,"Deadly Creatures is nice game when you have a Wii. The story is a bit fuzzy, but it’s ten times better than yet another party game for the system. What makes this game interesting is not the story, not the great graphics, but the fantastic fights and extremely well executed vibe the game sends out. Anyone lucky enough to have a Wii should definitely check this one out.",75
2710,178,516,14,"Simply put, such a unique game deserves to succeed, and there’s no doubt that Deadly Creatures is worth looking into for Wii owners.",75
2711,41,516,14,"The combat and motion controls are less than perfect, but the level design and cinematic storytelling really steal the show. Deadly Creatures offers a rare perspective that's very entertaining, if only for a brief time.",74
2712,145,516,14,"It's almost funny how seriously the game takes itself, but if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, this trip through the underground provides just enough of everything to be worth playing.",73
2713,110,516,14,"For gamers looking for something different on the Wii, this might be the ticket – provided that you’re willing to cope with the unpolished mechanics.",70
2714,255,516,14,"Rainbow Studios has made an strange game, a particularly bizarre one. It's an intriguing game that suffers from a lack of a deeper storyline. Its graphics are enough to make this game comfortable for any kind of player who is willing to discover a new way of understanding the greatness of Nature.",70
2715,413,516,14,Had Rainbow managed to solve a few of the combat problems and tidied up the presentation (and squeeze in a better story) THQ would have had one of the console's best games on its hands. For that reason it's a shame we've ended up with just an extremely competent and enjoyable one.,70
2716,31,516,14,"Make no mistake, it hardly comes close in terms of quality to the most vaunted titles of the console, but then again, addictive, joyful games for the Wii have been so thin on the ground of late that Deadly Creatures is bound - and perhaps deserves - to make some kind of an impact.",70
2717,120,516,14,"I give them double credit for doing it on the Wii—to attempt something that so clearly stands out from the piles of waggle-tastic, brightly-colored shovelware was a bold move, indeed. Although Deadly Creatures might not be entirely successful, I would call it a success. Rat",70
2718,325,516,14,"Deadly Creatures is an interesting concept that is commendable from a technical point of view, and is only let down by a few niggles.",70
2719,389,516,14,There hasn’t been a game since Mister Mosquito that has played with the idea of an insect-sized protagonist and pulled it off so well.,70
2720,277,516,14,"It's a different style of gameplay with very different protagonists and antagonists than gamers are used to. This is really what we need to see more of on the Wii though, and despite the flaws it's definitely worth checking out if you want to try something new.",70
2721,275,516,14,"You'll see interesting sights, but this doesn't capitalise on the ick factor or the thrill of seeing our world through a fresh set(s) of eyes.",68
2722,427,516,14,"As a tech demo, Deadly Creatures is an impressive piece of work, but as a game, it is merely average. For every good idea, there's something that holds back the game and prevents it from really shining.",63
2723,257,516,14,"Impressively original, and wonderfully grotesque, arachnid sim that's just a little short on gameplay.",60
2724,451,516,14,"While it may only just escape mediocrity, Deadly Creatures is entertaining enough to keep you playing until the end. [Mar 2009, p.122]",60
2725,99,516,14,"For Wii owners looking for something a little more adult, Deadly Creatures satisfies your sadistic cravings for carnage and blood, but lacks the polish to make it a keeper for any collection.",60
2726,179,516,14,"Fighting insects is an interesting if niche concept. But Deadly Creatures doesn't pull it off. [Apr 2009, p.75]",56
2727,78,516,14,"This actual action is not rendered with nearly half the imagination or proficiency as the premise offers – and six hours of Remote-induced carpal tunnel syndrome and grim boss-battling overstay their welcome. [Mar 2009, p.91]",50
2728,58,516,14,"The visuals and treasure-hunter plot (and the role that the tarantula and scorpion will play in it) hold just enough intrigue to keep you playing, but as a whole, it’s more a chore than an adventure.",50
2729,64,516,14,"Great character models, professional voice acting and initially enjoyable combat can’t make up for the other graphical and design mistakes.",50
2730,82,516,14,"Deadly Creatures has an intriguing premise, and makes a strong first impression with its shudder-inducing animation and cute environmental details. That may be enough to curry favour with Wii owners starved of action games, but over the long haul the scariest thing about these critters is how shoddily constructed they are.",40
2731,132,499,17,"If looks could kill, DOA4 would be called Murderer's Row. This game is beautiful; even while you're beating the tar out of your opponent, you'll notice that your surroundings are among the finest you've seen in any fighting game... Hands down the best installment in the series. [Jan 2006, p.38]",100
2732,68,499,17,The gorgeous and sometimes ludicrous backdrops offer a perfect complement to flowing fisticuffs.,100
2733,9,499,17,"Boasting amazing looks, stunning animation and instantly accessible yet deep gameplay that's hugely addictive, it's the kind of game that is not only awesome to show off the power of your beloved new 360, but will be a faithful companion for many months to come, thanks to a huge amount to do and a variety of modes both offline and on.",100
2734,448,499,17,"For fans of the series DOA4 is everything you could possibly want from a next-gen iteration of the game; a revamped fighting system, faster game play, and enough T&A to satisfy even the most jaded otaku.",100
2735,263,499,17,"The action, visuals, story, and sound blend together to make the most complete fighting game in years, and any real fighting fan knows Dead or Alive is no longer the game with all style and no substance.",98
2736,226,499,17,The most impressive and useful feature of DOA is the ability to counter an advance by another fighter. Bear in mind that countering requires precise timing and practice is the only way to perfect this art. I am still learning.,96
2737,71,499,17,There is little fault to be found in this game as the fighting is balanced and there are lots of engaging aspects of the title that demand your time.,96
2738,307,499,17,A stupendous online mode and a boastful display of graphical prowess complete the package. Dead or Alive 4 is the most complete and most enjoyable fighting game in the series.,95
2739,91,499,17,"High Kicks and breast physics don't hurt either. If you don't buy this game, you'll end up renting it repeatedly, so save yourself the money in the long-run and buy it outright.",95
2740,211,499,17,"So, Dead or Alive 4 has it all: sexy looks, sexy women, sexy sound, sexy gameplay, sexy online play, sexy... you get the picture.",95
2741,41,499,17,Not only is the game technically solid but it's a real looker. It's easily the best looking console game ever.,94
2742,30,499,17,"I only wish that the online mode was a bit more solid and less susceptible to lag, but overall it looks fantastic, flows very smoothly, and has plenty of replay value making this the best title for the 360 to date.",93
2743,147,499,17,"With over 45 achievements to collect and never-ending fighting matches online, you will not run out of things to do in this game for a long time.",93
2744,239,499,17,The best game currently out for the 360 and one of the best fighting games ever made.,92
2745,187,499,17,"Intensely frustrating, rewarding, and challenging, Dead or Alive 4 is not a game for those of us with short attention spans, anger management issues, or serious over competitiveness.",92
2746,436,499,17,The way they mixed in the Halo angle really made sense with the ongoing story and not just thrown in for the sake of a cheap promotion.,92
2747,372,499,17,"Put simply, Dead or Alive 4 is the best fighter Team Ninja has ever put together and it is easily the best looking game to play on the Xbox 360 in it’s early stages.",91
2748,371,499,17,"Team NINJA has the Midas touch, and it looks as if Itagaki gave this one a one-hour massage before release. It has challenging, in-depth gameplay, the best visuals the console has yet to experience, and enough replay value to kill a Kasumi clone.",91
2749,450,499,17,"Most definitely a game that carries the ""easy to play, difficult to master"" label, but is well worth mastering in the long run.",91
2750,136,499,17,"There’s nothing incredibly new or earth shattering here, but you can absolutely enjoy it for the fighting game that it is.",91
2751,1,499,17,"It's still ""just"" a fighting game, albeit an incredibly polished and finessed fighting game, but it won't open your eyes to things you've never seen before. It will bring the fighting game community together, however, thanks to its online functionality, and that's a good thing.",90
2752,213,499,17,"The counter system is less forgiving and will definitely challenge fans of the series, especially those fond of DOA3. This affects every other area of the game. The harder characters to master are even more powerful now, and there is more of a ground game, in addition to careful use of the backgrounds.",90
2753,446,499,17,"It's not a totally new slant on the genre, but a very slick refinement... Don't leave the girls of Dead or Alive 4 waiting; you'll regret it in more ways than one.",90
2754,253,499,17,"But it isn't just the best looking brawler around - it's also the deepest, as designers Team Ninja have complemented the game's responsive controls with hundreds of cool combo moves and tons of unlockable characters, outfits, and arenas.",90
2755,164,499,17,DOA4 is so close to being flawless it's unbelievable.,90
2756,249,499,17,To truly master any fighter you need to be proficient with all characters. DOA 4 offers an enjoyable yet frustrating experience depending on your levels of skill and patience.,90
2757,440,499,17,"I only one major complaint and that’s the last boss Alpha-152. While not the cheapest boss in a fighter I’ve ever nearly broken my controller over, she does have some angering abilities. Having a fight end in three moves (head blast, spinning kicks, locks your head and shoulder and pounds your head in) is more annoying then challenging.",90
2758,66,499,17,"Each character has multiple costumes to obtain, so the replay value of the story mode is somewhat lacking, unless you are a full blown fashionista who must have all the outfits the game has to offer.",90
2759,419,499,17,"The prettiest fighting franchise out there has grown some brains, upping the skill ante but also bringing a ton of online play modes and unlockable goodies to the table.",90
2760,383,499,17,"The controls feel less random and demand some extra skill, particularly in the countering system that allows one to block a punch and use its momentum to throw an opponent. The game lacks the intuitive feel of similar fighting series like Tekken and Soul Calibur, but it is still tremendous fun.",90
2761,118,499,17,The biggest unique feature to the online component of DOA 4 is definitely the psychedelic crack land known as the lobby...The lobby is so strange and so far removed from what DOA is visually that you really feel like the developers went a bit mad at some point and threw this in for a laugh and a half.,90
2762,111,499,17,"Unlockable costumes, characters, and achievements only serve to keep you going. It may not be as technical as a Virtua Fighter, or as tournament-friendly as a Street Fighter, but it is a ton of fun.",90
2763,110,499,17,"The incredible craftsmanship that went into this title makes it the pinnacle in the series and another fantastic Xbox Live application. [Mar 2006, p.108]",90
2764,50,499,17,"DOA4 over Xbox Live is quite an experience. It succeeds on a technical level, but the real reason that it's such a riot is the game underneath. The enjoyable, solid, beautiful game that is Dead or Alive 4. This is the definitive title in the series and, as far as we're concerned, the ultimate game in its genre. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]",90
2765,120,499,17,"Simply put, Team Ninja deserves a truckload of praise for their work on this game.",90
2766,113,499,17,"There was a time when Dead or Alive was the poor man’s Tekken, Soul Calibur or Virtua Fighter, but in some regards, particularly where environmental and visual quality is concerned, the series has taken the lead.",90
2767,439,499,17,"It really is a beautiful game, truly 'next gen' in appearance if not gameplay.",90
2768,389,499,17,"Dead or Alive games used to be all about huge, bouncing breasts and overly simplistic, easy to pick up gameplay. No longer. DOA shall henceforth be known for huge, bounding breasts and a refined and deep fighting system.",90
2769,321,499,17,"Overall, a truly Next Gen title that is hopefully a sign of things to come as this console matures.",90
2770,406,499,17,"If you can get past that insanely hard computer AI and keep practicing away, then you will find yourself one of the best fighters on the market.",89
2771,195,499,17,"A robust online mode is available, but playing solo won’t leave you bored after a couple of play-throughs.",89
2772,427,499,17,"Dead or Alive 4 has enough new content in it to set it apart, and although the gameplay itself is liberally borrowed from the previous title, it also remains the same solid fighting engine and definitely doesn't feel like a rehash as much as it does a resemblance.",89
2773,325,499,17,"It has the most evolved gameplay system, without loosing the 'pick up and play' feel every beat 'em up should have.",89
2774,140,499,17,"An impressive feat of a fighting game that boasts some excellent, fast-paced action in addition to terrific good looks. Best of all, you can play it online over Xbox Live, virtually guaranteeing you'll find tough, unpredictable competition at any hour.",88
2775,320,499,17,"A must-buy for any fighting fan and an excellent game for demonstrating the power of Xbox 360. It is not the revolution many expected, but it is still easily the best game in the series. [Feb 2006]",88
2776,433,499,17,"It is definitely the finest of the series, and is an achievement with the online modes, and the best looking fighter out on the market to date. It isn’t exactly for everyone though, as it can be difficult in single and multiplayer portions of the game.",86
2777,108,499,17,"The combat engine has been refined to the point where veterans of the series might have a tougher time than newcomers, but there are plenty of rewards waiting for those who can master this next-gen fighter.",86
2778,369,499,17,"The legs are long, the sex is gratuitous, and the violence is very, very violent. DOA 4 is definitely firing on all pistons. Still, for a series with the word ""alive"" on the box cover, these characters all seem kind of plastic, hollow, heartless, and downright bloodless.",85
2779,289,499,17,"Fan’s of Itagaki’s “jujitsu-jousting” philosophy….can comfortably mark DOA 4 as the most refined version of their beloved fighter to date. [Mar 2006, p.73]",85
2780,21,499,17,"In the end, Dead or Alive 4 is to fighting games what Halo 2 was to first person shooters.",85
2781,348,1580,9,Mugen Souls Z represents a valiant effort and shows bounding improvements over its predecessor.,82
2782,74,1580,9,"As much fun as it is to play, the sad irony of Mugen Souls Z is that it is best played by people who hadn't experienced the original, but the only people that could possibly be interested in the game must have played the original.",80
2783,329,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z is a fun RPG that doesn't try to be serious. As such, it leaves the storyline convoluted, messy, and boring to sit through. If you have the patience to get through it though, then the combat system, character customization and all the extra goodies more than make up for it.",75
2784,204,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z isn’t a great RPG, but it’s an entertaining one, and there’s enough meat on its bones to keep you playing for a good long while.",70
2785,84,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z is a good JRPG with interesting mechanics, a good combat system and a deep and entertaining character customization. Despite the graphics and the long story sequences, this is a good experience for gamers who like these kinds of products.",70
2786,262,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z is quit similar to its prequel and offers the same basic experience with sub-par visuals and overlong dialogues and cut-scenes. Plot is all over the place, but its unique and rather funny combat system keeps things engaging.",70
2787,120,1580,9,"With adorable characters having wacky adventures in space, Mugen Souls Z's charm and the solid writing kept me motivated to zip through the storyline, and the fights are still a thrill... It's just too bad that the deadly-dull non-combat sections and the ending-ruining bug keep me from recommending the game wholeheartedly.",70
2788,188,1580,9,"Go into it with your eyes open, and it may end up being a pretty fun experience.",67
2789,316,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z feels like a rehashed, more tedious version of its predecessor that wasn't really needed.",62
2790,41,1580,9,"Just like many of the game's secondary characters, it will be difficult for most players to be convinced that experiencing Chou-Chou's charms is worth the attendant drudgery.",60
2791,427,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z does little to rock the boat, so fans of the original might be interested in revisiting this title, but anyone else will want to give it a pass.",60
2792,448,1580,9,"If you’re into the anime style games and don’t mind trekking through a good amount of inconsequential dialog, it’s not a bad choice.",60
2793,220,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z boasts a lot of content and all the fan service you could want, the lack of challenge, the bad writing and the mediocre graphics drag it down. Only for fans.",60

2795,377,1580,9,"Nevertheless, for anyone who enjoyed the first game Mugen Souls Z is more of the same, slightly refined and smartened up. For those accustomed to big-budget JRPGs – Ni No Kuni, Tales of Xillia – it definitely looks like a budget title and will underwhelm.",60
2796,328,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z feels like more of its predecessor, with the same plodding story pace, whiny, forgettable cast, and fill-in-the-action cutscenes.",55
2797,408,1580,9,"It improves certain aspects of the original game, but still, some basic elements like gameplay and plot don't seem to work as they should.",55
2798,5,1580,9,"As a tactical roleplaying game it serves its purpose, but when it comes to details in storytelling or game mechanics it becomes monotonous rather quickly.",51
2799,387,1580,9,"Fans will no doubt appreciate the new gameplay features but, as a whole, Mugen Souls Z feels too exclusive a game, even for a sequel. Its niche narrative focus and penchant for superficiality make it a hard sell for newcomers.",50
2800,345,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z is, on the surface, a shallow but agreeable JRPG that hides a deeper, heavier set of systems for genre fans that care to search for them.",50
2801,186,1580,9,There are plenty of half-naked anime girls to be found for free on the Internet.,50
2802,361,1580,9,"As if the first Mugen Souls wasn't niche enough, Mugen Souls Z ventures even further down into the cavernous, kaleidoscopic portal of moe lure and outlandish fetishes, rarely coming up for air.",50
2803,115,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z relies heavily on underboob, sideboob, and boob windows to get the job done, but this is not the full extent of the overt sexism, fetishism, or hypersexualization.",40
2804,200,1580,9,"Mugen Souls Z is a bland, generic JRPG. The only thing that makes it stand out from the crowd is the rampant sex that runs through it. Personally I found it distasteful; games are better than this, and Mugen Souls Z is the precise reason why the entire medium gets viewed as juvenile. If you like JRPGs you could probably do worse – nothing about it is broken – but you could also do a hell of a lot better.",40
2805,39,1580,9,Mugen Souls Z wears its perverseness on its sleeve (or panties as it may be) but underneath that there’s a competent if clunky JRPG that doesn’t do enough to differentiate itself. It’s a bizarre game that helps serve as a reminder of how weird and different Japanese games can be but it never ascends beyond being a delivery vessel for crude humour and pervy art.,40

2817,111,2152,8,"Persona 3 is, despite that complaint, one of the best RPGs on the PS2, and in fact, on any console. It has characters you'll care about, a combat system that's easy to get into but hard to master, enough of a difficulty curve that you'll feel like you're working for your victories, and a truly bizarre and memorable soundtrack.",92
2818,108,2152,8,"With an intriguing story, varied and fun gameplay, awesome graphics, a catchy soundtrack, and tons and tons of stuff to do, Persona 3 is easily one of the best RPGs to come out for the PS2 this year, if not the best, period.",91

2828,9,2152,8,"The RPG and turn-based elements might put you off those who aren't fond of the genre, but the game excels in storytelling, story arcing, animation and character building so well that it's worth taking a chance even if you're not a fan.",90

2838,325,2152,8,"You might well think that Persona 3 is a mishmash of very ""Japanese"" ideas, and you'd be right. But it's all down to the execution of these ideas and this game has managed to combine some very peculiar elements into a very delicious package.",86

2846,316,2152,8,"But the story really does take too long to unfold, the battle environment is far too repetitive and often boring, you don't have as much control as you would like (only controlling one character isn't much fun), the soundtrack gets ridiculously repetitive at times, and there's no actual world map you can physically explore.",84

2852,147,2152,8,"If you like games that step outside the bounds of normality – games that defy reality and present the strangest imagery imaginable – Persona 3 is your RPG. But if you prefer the lighter Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy style of games, stick with those. Persona 3 was not made for that audience.",79
2853,165,2152,8,"Persona 3 is a fairly unique game, in that it combines stale and tried elements to make them fresh. The presentation is good, and the environments are crisp. This is definitely a game only for the true RPG faithful.",75
2854,71,2152,8,"While dark and moody and supernaturally-tainted, Persona 3’s obsession with the day-to-day school humdrum of its main characters’ lives delivers some unique game play ideas, but also transform it into a love-it-or-hate-it affair. Recommended only for SMT fans.",75

2857,130,1219,8,"You’ll be hard pressed to find another game that even comes close to matching the quality found in Kingdom Hearts. Games just don’t come as beautiful and well thought out as this, it’s a virtual masterpiece that excels in every way possible.",100
2858,317,1219,8,"In the end this is THE game of the year as far as I am concerned and even exceeded the amount of fun I had with ""Final Fantasy X"" a year ago.",100
2859,453,1219,8,"Each world is full of colors, whether it be lush green environments of a jungle, or the sandy feeling you get in the desert, each world is chock full of beautiful and vibrant colors that jump out at you more than Mexican jumping beans.",97
2860,110,1219,8,"The battles that unfold are as beautful as they are intense, and as difficult as they are easy to manhandle. [Oct 2002, p.76]",95

2862,395,1219,8,I really don’t think anyone else could have woven as complex and enthralling a story into such enjoyable gameplay and kept it as true to both Square and especially Disney fans.,93
2863,111,1219,8,"Although the game’s graphics and music were as incredible as you can expect from these two very professional companies, the actual gameplay does get a tiny bit repetitive at times. Overall, Kingdom Hearts manages to be an incredible game.",92

2865,191,1219,8,"The moment I picked it up, it was hard to separate me from it. And as I've told many already, any game that can make me smile as much as this game does is definitely a gem of its own.",91
2866,128,1219,8,"This is the kind of game you'll play obsessively until you get to the end credits - and then you'll play it again to find all the godies you missed on the first go. [Oct 2002, p.46]",91
2867,195,1219,8,"The action nature of this game makes the length shorter as there is little to no strategy as there is in turn-based games. I doubt many will want to go through this game again, but for the first time through the game was quite rewarding.",91
2868,213,1219,8,For something with a goofball camera like this to nevertheless remain a compelling action-RPG requires some substantial assets in other areas.,90
2869,186,1219,8,Composer Yoko Shimomura (his first Square title since Legend of Mana) creates a very impressive score that alternates between filling you with excitement as you start your next battle to pulling at the heartstrings when some of the game’s more poignant scenes are onscreen.,90
2870,168,1219,8,"The game is way fun, chock full o’ stars and actually a lengthy, deep game that’s appropriate for all ages.",90
2871,11,1219,8,"Visually stunning, loaded with cameos and dripping with both Square and Disney nostalgia, Kingdom Hearts will grab you from the opening to the end.",90
2872,393,1219,8,"You’ll be particularly impressed with the recreation of the Disney characters, it seems as though they’ve been translated to videogame characters without any compromises.",90

2874,132,1219,8,"Oh, if only those Gummi Ship segments didn’t exist! They’re the only blemish in what’s otherwise the best action/RPG since the two N64 Zeldas.",90
2875,394,1219,8,A totally engrossing experience.,90
2876,8,1219,8,"With over 60 hours of gameplay and hundreds of animated characters both familiar and a new, Kingdom Hearts should prove a massive hit over the festive season.",89
2877,431,1219,8,"The depth and detail in this game is unbelievable and Disney and Square have thought of absolutely everything, down to every last detail in all the worlds and the appearances of the Disney and Final Fantasy characters.",87
2878,180,1219,8,"For all its faults [camera, linear progress], this is one of the most vividly imagined, sprawling and openly heart-warming games on PS2. [PSM2]",87
2879,19,1219,8,The music is one of those touches that really remind you that this is a Disney property. All of the musical scores for the worlds are either originals or very strikingly similar ones.,87
2880,159,1219,8,"Such a well-crafted, polished (aside from the camera), and entertaining experience that it managed to win over this jaded gaming cynic, inevitable merchandising tie-ins and all.",86
2881,80,1219,8,"Even with wussy characters and settings all over the place, the story and gameplay in Kingdom Hearts rivals the ""Final Fantasy"" series. [Oct 2002, p.182]",85
2882,108,1219,8,"It may not rival the grand stories of some past Final Fantasy’s or even some of the better Disney movies; however, it is a fine game that manages to combine each company’s strengths in a tapestry that is a joy to behold and an even greater one to play.",85
2883,79,1219,8,"If the game was not so brilliantly presented with such rich characters, story and astounding art and voice-work (best voice-work to date in a videogame), you would probably take more notice of the simple and boring adventure elements (go here, go there, find this, talk to that person...), and the too-heavy reliance on melee combat, and the constant battles, and the frustration of having to take two steps back to level up before being able to take the all-important third step forward in a world.",85
2884,142,1219,8,"While I would have liked more cohesion in the plot and more depth in the combat, the overall package is filled with enough fun and surprises to keep you playing through the end.",84
2885,45,1219,8,"The problem is that it just gets old quick. Lots of enemies, attack, cure, wash, rinse, repeat. It gets old.",83
2886,115,1219,8,"Boasts probably the most talented pool of voice actors ever collected for a video game, from several star-studded notables to Disney's fantastic stable of character actors. These voices vividly bring the characters to life.",83
2887,81,1219,8,"Works surprisingly well on a creative level...Much less successful, however, is a poorly conceived in-game camera system that often gets stuck behind objects and orients itself in the wrong direction. [20 Sept 2002]",83
2888,229,1219,8,"For as few times that Kingdom Hearts made me frustrated with the camera and repeat visits, the number of times I was happy with my trip through the story more than made up for it.",83
2889,140,1219,8,"Great, largely because it successfully captures the spirit of both Square and Disney in a single game.",82
2890,323,1219,8,"To say that Kingdom Hearts is magical is an understatement. As cinematic experiences go, it's exquisite. It's not the finest in terms of action, but overall, it's wonderful. [Oct 2002, p.74]",80
2891,99,1219,8,"The renowned charm of Disney's characters, the stylistic panache of ""Final Fantasy"" folk, and a well-designed gameplay makes up for Kingdom Hearts' relatively few shortcomings.",80
2892,44,1219,8,A fun and refreshingly accessible RPG that fuses Japanese storytelling and game play with an unprecedented repertoire of recognizable Disney icons.,80
2893,82,1219,8,"It’s as cryptic to begin with as any game ever conceived by Square, and it lures you in with some tremendous combat mechanics and a unique selling point (Disney), but it also tries to piss you off with a vacuous opening zone and the Chipmunks.",80
2894,41,1219,8,"My biggest, heartiest complaint regarding KH is the slap together shooting stages between levels. They are so out of place and so frustratingly poorly executed that they should have not only been left on the cutting room floor.",80
2895,105,1219,8,"When the amazing, talented artists from Square join forces with the amazing, talented artists from Disney, good things happen. [Feb 2003, p.92]",80
2896,311,1219,8,"This game has got to have on of the worst camera systems in an RPG ever. [Oct 2002, p.38]",80
2897,184,1219,8,"This enchanted kingdom certainly has its flaws, but it's still well worth a visit.",80
2898,444,1219,8,"Almost every individual aspect of the game except for the camera is well executed, but the two key components of the title still don't go seem to belong together.",75
2899,188,1219,8,"Despite the sometimes annoying, repetitive combat sequences, Kingdom Hearts is filled with plenty to see and do.",75
2900,450,1219,8,"Where the game begins to lose some of its luster is in the areas of sound and story, and a camera that suffers from a lack of intuition. The music is not so much repetitive as it is boring.",70
2901,120,1219,8,"It might have been possible to deal with such a ridiculously bad setup if melee was limited to bosses and occasional encounters, but in a wicked bit of irony, the miserable perspective is paired with an insanely ludicrous amount of battling.",60
2902,446,1219,8,"Gameplay is probably the most unremarkable aspect to Kingdom Hearts. The real-time combat consists of mashing the X button repeatedly as your one and only attack move, and also using magic once and a while.",60
2903,332,1300,9,"There simply isn't anything else like LBP on any system, anywhere. It's a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand. [Nov 2008, p.92]",100
2904,252,1300,9,"LBP is a unique game. It disguises itself as a 2D platform game but surprises the players with a set of editing tools and level sharing absolutely amazing. With a distinctive style and an everlasting future potential, we can say that Sackboy already conquered this industry. [Oct 2008]",100
2905,152,1300,9,"LittleBigPlanet is like a magic trick, and in that respect it feels less like a videogame than an incredible concept executed perfectly. LittleBigPlanet is like LEGO (the blocks, not the game), it’s like Monopoly, it’s timeless... it’s lightning in a bottle – and if Sony play their cards right it could well save the PS3, and propel the console into the stratosphere.",100
2906,132,1300,9,"There's really nothing I can say other than this: if you own a PS3 and you don't buy LittleBigPlanet, you are robbing yourself of one of the most unique gaming experiences ever designed.",100
2907,393,1300,9,"Undoubtedly one of the finest games in recent years, LittleBigPlanet deserves every single shred of a 10. You won't find a more polished or rewarding videogame this year, and for quite some time we'd imagine.",100
2908,78,1300,9,"It’s a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both. [Dec 2008, p.76]",100
2909,99,1300,9,It’s so satisfying to finally have a game that not only lives up to the hype but exceeds it so many ways it’s almost unfair.,100
2910,239,1300,9,LBP is one of the most important games to be released this decade. A tall order with the hype machine running overtime for the game but the way it reinvents how video games are played is sure to have lasting effects indefinitely. It is impossible not to fall in love with all the charm LBP oozes.,100
2911,1,1300,9,"Yes, it's the most charming game that I've ever played, and it's one of the most enjoyable. But the real beauty of LBP is even less tangible: creative empowerment at its finest and an unparalleled motivator to want to create.",100
2912,115,1300,9,"Little Big Planet is just what Doctor Sony ordered: universally appealing gameplay with an appealing everyman hero that is connected to streaming delivery of new content. Sony should be lauded for such a gamble, and Media Molecule should be praised. This is a rare toy that has the capacity to inspire the inventor, the explorer, and the gamer.",100
2913,448,1300,9,Consider the purchase of your PS3 more than justified.,100
2914,63,1300,9,The best game I’ve played all year. It is an extremely fun platformer with stunning graphics not to mention the most extensive level creation tool I’ve ever seen.,100
2915,376,1300,9,"When Sackboy drifts into freefall while skateboarding down a steep incline, that sinking feeling in your gut means that the game's exquisitely tuned physics are working.",100
2916,188,1300,9,"LittleBigPlanet is a beautiful, happy, extremely eye-pleasing game that will put a smile on anyone's face who plays or merely watches it. Like Sackboy himself, it's impossible to not find the game both attractive and aesthetically pleasing.",100
2917,58,1300,9,LittleBigPlanet is gaming’s equivalent to YouTube: an unprecedented channel of collective talent that offers a level of creative freedom never before seenin a commercial videogame. It does for the platform genre what Half-Life did for shooters and what Gran Turismo did for racers; injecting innovation into a rapidly-staling genre and paving the way for the future of the side-scrolling platformer.,100
2918,389,1300,9,"LittleBigPlanet is much more than simply a game or even a tool, it’s an experience. The sack people are an infectiously charming bunch and as soon as you’ve settled in you’ll want to stay for the foreseeable future.",100
2919,387,1300,9,"A stunning, powerfully confident title that deserves all the praise it’s ever been awarded, the Media Molecule guys should be so pleased with what they’ve managed to accomplish and just as much good feeling goes the way of Sony for putting so much faith in the game and getting behind it 100%.",100
2920,199,1300,9,"When it's at its best, LittleBigPlanet offers excitement and the thrill of discovery in ways that no other console game ever has.",100

2922,333,1300,9,"It's too early yet to declare a new era or direction in gaming, but LittleBigPlanet feels like the birth of a revolution; like through sharing our collective creativity we'll somehow become better, stronger, closer to each other. [Holiday 2008, p.56]",100
2923,9,1300,9,"The online community is brimming with endlessly different styles of maps, as each of the creators' personalities are poured into the fun of constructing them. LittleBigPlanet will undoubtedly keep you up at night, constructing the next big hit for the community - and if you don't care for that then you can still play the plethora of maps being produced by countless others.",100
2924,64,1300,9,"The developers should be applauded for creating a profoundly personal work that still overtly appealing to the audience at large. But even though it is not the best platformer out there, the game can quite easily be classed as something entirely original for the genre, casting off a brand new tangent filled with wondrous sights and provocative ideas that are enchantingly imaginative and creative enough to be considered truly exceptional.",100

2930,108,1300,9,LittleBigPlanet is a fantastic platformer game that many people are sure to love with its wide variety of elements and content. Level design may not be for everyone but you are sure to have plenty of levels with the community as well as those in the game.,98

2932,246,1300,9,The single player game alone is worth the price of admission. It offers a level of detail and value that no other game on the market right now can match.

3030,192,1259,17,"Just like on the PC, the 360 version of Left 4 Dead is just immensely fun to play. Whether you go on the hunt or are the hunted, Left 4 Dead will leave you wanting more every time you finish a campaign.",91

3032,213,1259,17,There's absolutely no doubt that Left 4 Dead is one of the most social and exciting multiplayer games that we've ever played. It's almost pitch perfect in how it captures the tension and the action of a Hollywood zombie movie.,90
3033,142,1259,17,"The inventive and highly entertaining competitive multiplayer mode just adds to the experience, and we're looking forward to seeing what Valve's got planned for the game's future.

3036,178,1259,17,"When playing with friends, Left4Dead gives the best cooperative experience in gaming, hands down. Nothing compares. The game is lacking a bit in terms of content, and more weapons and locations would definitely add to the experience, but nothing can take away from the sheer enjoyment value. Valve’s newest might be one of their most masterfully crafted, and the attention to detail is impeccable.",90
3037,428,1259,17,"While it’s easy to say that it’s not so great offline, Left 4 Dead is supposed to be played with friends and when you do it’s hard to find any flaws. Very fun, very slick and very dead.",90
3038,413,1259,17,"There are games you want everyone to play, just so they can experience what you've such a good time with, and Left 4 Dead is one of them. It's unlike any other game I've ever played and demonstrates the true power of cooperative gameplay.",90
3039,9,1259,17,"Fun, frantic, fresh, innovative, stylish and addictive, Left 4 Dead is a game that you will enjoy when playing alone and fall in love with when playing with friends. It's what survival horror is all about: teamwork, desperation and endurance - and in terms of crafting an atmospheric, pulse-racing FPS experience, Valve have absolutely outdone even themselves.",90
3040,57,1259,17,"Left 4 Dead proves that zombies don’t have to be dumb and slow! The game’s definite pro is its brilliant versus mode. The campaign mode is nice to have, but nothing more.",90
3041,52,1259,17,"Left 4 Dead is a fantastic game. Not exactly flawless, but tremendous fun. And by tremendous fun, I mean the equivalent of riding the best roller-coaster in the world, whilst eating the best piece of cake in the world, whilst the most beautiful woman in the world does unspeakable things to you.",90
3042,58,1259,17,"Left 4 Dead transcends the black and white of 'single player' or 'multiplayer' – suddenly there's a realisation that four players have amalgamated into a single, unified body during play. It's an incredibly exhilarating feeling, and other games offering co-op modes that amount to little more than running and gunning together suddenly appear a little juvenile. Left 4 Dead has indefinitely raised the bar for true co-operative play.",90
3043,396,1259,17,Overall this is a fantastic game to play with friends. If you can get a good group of guys together playing this you will have a blast.,90

3049,4,1259,17,"Left 4 Dead is one of the most pleasant surprises of this final quarter of 2008. Without making too much noise it brings a very interesting set, in which the cooperative campaign is its main breakthrough. Short, thrilling and intense.",87
3050,145,1259,17,"Left 4 Dead is a fun game while it lasts, but that’s not long. There’s not much nuance to the combat or weapons, but the realistic enemy behavior gives it a sense of unpredictability.",86
3051,155,1259,17,It comes down to this: Left 4 Dead is a hell of a lot of fun to play.,86
3052,140,1259,17,"Between the tense campaign and the frenetic Versus mode, Left 4 Dead offers two distinct flavors of multiplayer action that are equally delicious when enjoyed with friends.

3056,225,1259,7,"The game is exactly what so many fans of the zombie horror films have longed for, for so so long.",100
3057,246,1259,7,L4D is the next best thing to a real-life zombie apocalypse with fun and excitement in abundance.,97
3058,447,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead is, above anything else, a fun and replayable co-op experience. Everything is elaborately designed to support the co-op gameplay and the moody zombie theme. So it doesn't have a heavily scripted 30-hour storyline with dozens of maps? Who cares! Refreshingly original and polished to the point of being a textbook case how to make a proper PC game.",95
3059,204,1259,7,"All in all, if you know from the start you are getting into a game that is entirely based around its cooperative multiplayer elements you are going to be rewarded with hundreds of hours of the best gaming experience you have had in years.",95
3060,194,1259,7,Left 4 Dead is a fantastic experience so long as you can get yourself into games with good players.,95
3061,296,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead's emphasis on teamwork and vague hints of story may not appeal to gamers who demand a focused single-player experience, but for the millions out there who have ever imagined their role in the inevitable Zombie Apocalypse, it simply cannot be missed. [Jan 2009, p.30]",94
3062,297,1259,7,"It's got all the nail-biting high tension of a control point assault/defence of Team-Fortress 2, mixed with the tightly designed levels of Half-Life 2 and the weapons of Counter-Strike. As long as they keep introducing new missions, there's no reason why it won't be sucking on your bandwidth for years to come.",93
3063,38,1259,7,Left 4 Dead is simply spectacular.,93
3064,21,1259,7,"If you're looking for the cooperative PC experience of 2008 and you're more interested in guns and zombies than in orcs and swords, then Left 4 Dead is very much a must-have game.",93
3065,304,1259,7,"A monumental pillar in multiplayer gaming; playing it without yelping in delight is like eating a doughnut without licking your lips. [Jan 2009, p.54]",93
3066,223,1259,7,"One of the finest zombie games ever made, and one of the finest co-op games ever made. The potential for everything to go so, so wrong without warning, or conversely to pull off the most spectacular escapes against all odds, means this is an online shooter you can tell your finest anecdotes about without boring everyone else to tears.",92
3067,295,1259,7,"Possibly too relentless for the less devout mouse-jockey, but it's astounding proof that being a brain-dead shooter is a very good thing. [Jan 2009, p.86]",92
3068,193,1259,7,"As it stands, Left 4 Dead is a great game, and Valve is continually improving it with patches already released and a content update promised for the near future.",92
3069,325,1259,7,"There's so much tension and just pure fun to be had here that it is quite impossible to ignore, and if you're a player that craves genuine team cohesion then this could be one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences you've ever had. The only thing this game is missing is a G-String clad and rotting Jenna Jameson.",91
3070,192,1259,7,"While it's a short campaign, the game's solid as a rock and offers a good deal of replayability.",91

3072,111,1259,7,"Unless you're genuinely lacking anyone to play it with though, Left 4 Dead is easily one of this year's must-have games.",91
3073,213,1259,7,There's absolutely no doubt that Left 4 Dead is one of the most social and exciting multiplayer games that we've ever played. It's almost pitch perfect in how it captures the tension and the action of a Hollywood zombie movie.,90
3074,142,1259,7,"The inventive and highly entertaining competitive multiplayer mode just adds to the experience, and we're looking forward to seeing what Valve's got planned for the game's future. Out of all the titles that have shaped the Year of Living Cooperatively, this may be the best experience of them all.",90
3075,78,1259,7,"Valve has taken something unscripted and dynamic, and seeded it with the right amount of narrative flavour, pacing and spectacle. [Christmas 2008, p.82]",90
3076,82,1259,7,"Another deeply professional, personality-filled and progressive take on the shooter from Valve. In a cultural landscape that has as many zombie touchstones as ours, it takes something special to make them shamble appealingly, and Left 4 Dead, both literally and metaphorically, makes them run.",90
3077,413,1259,7,"There are games you want everyone to play, just so they can experience what you've such a good time with, and Left 4 Dead is one of them. It's unlike any other game I've ever played and demonstrates the true power of cooperative gameplay.",90
3078,67,1259,7,"As a co-op game, Left 4 Dead is literally the best the genre has ever seen. As a competitive experience, it's still very entertaining, but ultimately conflicted and uneven. But that's okay: I'll just play campaign that much more.",90
3079,425,1259,7,"If you enjoy playing first-person shooters with a team of friends or even complete strangers, Left 4 Dead offers an unparalleled social experience. It can be frustrating at times when the team's actions aren't synced, or strategies continually falter, but a bit of practice and, more importantly, communication will transform this zombie massacre into one of the most exciting and addictive gaming experiences ever.",90
3080,9,1259,7,"A truly monumental achievement, not only for Valve but for the games industry as a whole - this is what the concept of co-operative play is all about and this is the definitive implementation of it thus far.",90
3081,427,1259,7,Left 4 Dead is a shining example of zombies done right in a video game. It's an action-packed riot with gore galore and is four times as fun with friends.,90
3082,160,1259,7,Even people who dislike zombies will probably change their minds after playing Left 4 Dead. The game offers much more than just killing zombies by the hundred. It offers lots and lots of gameplay with an unique combination of a tactical shooter with good old fashioned humour.,90
3083,57,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead proves that zombies don’t have to be dumb and slow! The game’s definite pro is its brilliant versus mode. The campaign mode is nice to have, but nothing more.",90
3084,178,1259,7,"When playing with friends, Left4Dead gives the best cooperative experience in gaming, hands down. Nothing compares. The game is lacking a bit in terms of content, and more weapons and locations would definitely add to the experience, but nothing can take away from the sheer enjoyment value.",90
3085,10,1259,7,The game works excellently both as a co-op game and as a classic competitive multiplayer experience.,90
3086,392,1259,7,"Its bravery and stunning execution deserve plaudits while its addictive nature deserves a health warning. [Issue#15, p.58]",90
3087,86,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead means fun and adrenaline in its SinglePlayer mode or in the phenomenal co-op Multiplayer, where only the lack of some more options blew the chances to seek new highs. It's like drugs, once you have it, it's impossible to drop. L4D is especially dedicated to all FPS fans who love pure and non-stop action.",90
3088,320,1259,7,"Valve hits gold again and turns zombie apocalypse into year’s best co-op-shooter. The tank doesn’t really fit the game, otherwise it’s a winner. [Jan 2009]",90
3089,322,1259,7,"Foaming at the mouth, with a mad glint in the eye and a trio of trusted friends watching your back - that's how it's played. And there's no stepping away from it. When the consensus was that there's hardly anything more to invent in the survival horror genre, Valve proved it wrong. No other game made me give the medikit to another player despite being hurt myself. [Jan 2009]",90
3090,147,1259,7,Left 4 Dead is a great multiplayer shooter with many elements that you won’t find in any other shooter this year. The co-op experience is unrivaled and the dynamic AI is an excellent design choice.,89
3091,4,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead is one of the most pleasant surprises of this final quarter of 2008. Without making too much noise it brings a very interesting set, in which the cooperative campaign is its main breakthrough. Short, thrilling and intense.",88
3092,48,1259,7,"So Left 4 Dead is basically the „Royale with Cheese” of this year’s multiplayer shooters. Just that the french fries next to it aren’t covered in mayo, but blood.",88
3093,197,1259,7,"Besides five boss monsters, there are over 1000 zombie models, which have been designed very well and seem to be taken out of a zombie movie, … a good one!",88
3094,7,1259,7,"L4D’s Versus mode is on par with Call of Duty 4 in terms of drama and tension. Every battle is a Hollywood blockbuster, an endless well of war stories about bravery, team spirit, betrayal, and cunning tricks.",88
3095,143,1259,7,"It's a playable zombie movie. Would you like to hunt down the infected or rather rip human flesh to shreds? What may look like a simple shooter turns out to be very challenging, scary and a lot of fun. The game may be short, but with great replay value and different ways to play like versus mode or co-op mode.",87
3096,145,1259,7,"Left 4 Dead is a fun game while it lasts, but that’s not long. There’s not much nuance to the combat or weapons, but the realistic enemy behavior gives it a sense of unpredictability.",86
3097,175,1259,7,"If you love good stories and are seeking for a long and player-focused singleplayer experience, Left 4 Dead is definitely not the shooter for you to get this Christmas. If you consider yourself a multiplayer enthusiast who’s looking for a true, old-school coop shooter, on the other hand, this could well be your GotY!",86
3098,155,1259,7,It comes down to this: Left 4 Dead is a hell of a lot of fun to play.,86
3099,255,1259,7,"The zombie apocalypse has begun in a small town in the USA. Everything and everyone is at stake. Four players must survive, playing together, fighting agains hordes of zombies. A great co-op shooter and an excellent game in the genre, which lets us live a horrible nightmare.",85

3101,152,1259,7,"Gripes aside, Left 4 Dead is a well polished experience that is an absolute blast to play co-operatively with mates (or randoms for that matter).",85
3102,293,1259,7,"While it arrives with a meagre number of campaigns to play through, the edge of your seat gameplay and team-based focus of the title make Left 4 Dead the most comprehensive co-op title on the market at this time.",85

However, the game is so repetitive and simple than it could be only enjoyable by The Sims fans.",60
3105,449,2612,2,"The Sims 2: Apartment Pets is fairly engaging for a few hours, but unfortunately it becomes stale very quickly as the Sim character itself requires far too little attention. A great concept, but owing to the awkward controls and the lack of care needed for the Sim, there’s just too much monotony.",60
3106,108,2612,2,"Gamers, especially young gamers, who like Sims, enjoy playing with digital pets, and don’t mind repetition might still enjoy this one, though.",60

3122,316,577,9,"It’s intricate, complex, rewarding, and always addictive. It keeps you coming back for more because you simply must power up just a little more. It’s the hook that makes it dangerous for me to play any Disgaea game, damnit.",82
3123,284,577,9,"While a sequel to the first game in the series, A Brighter Darkness does more than doff its cap to the original, bringing tweaks to the gameplay that offer fresh ways to play with the best loved characters making a welcome return.",80
3124,200,577,9,"Disgaea D2 is a silly game, but it’s a surprisingly smart one, too. A little grind-y it may be, but it’s still impossible to deny that it remains entertaining in its story scenes and engaging in its combat.",80

Disgaea 4 took the series to new places, opening up multiplayer and community, but A Brighter Darkness doesn’t do anything as impressive. This is even more disappointing if you are a fan anticipating a reunion with beloved characters.",75
3138,395,577,9,If you aren't already a fan of this franchise Disgaea D2 won't draw you in to its weird world. Series fans will find the familiar here and NIS went out of their way to provide plenty of jokes just for the real fans.,75

3143,120,577,9,"It’s a shame Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness is a direct sequel. Despite niggling issues and a lackluster story compared to the original, it’s the most forgiving Disgaea to date.

3158,320,2047,14,Table Tennis Wii is the same game as the Xbox 360 version. Nothing’s changed apart from the controls. Rockstar has done fine job adapting the controls to suit Wii’s nunchuk and Wiimote. The game is at its best when played with friends.

3176,123,2047,14,"While it contains some cool features in the form of three unique play styles and finely tuned audio, the game's timing is almost completely off, even with such simplicities as a serve or a ball return. The visuals also took a step backward.",60
3177,110,2047,14,"While it’s still a passably good time, it’s not even close to the fast and precise feel that this title achieved on the 360.",60
3178,142,2047,14,"If you hadn't played or owned the Xbox 360 previously, you're getting a rather short, mostly entertaining table tennis game. However, for those of you who've played the 360 game, double-dipping would be a mistake. You're paying the same price the 360 version released for to get a graphically downgraded and stripped version of what was a rather exceptional 360 game.",60
3179,192,2047,14,"Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a real mixed bag; on one hand the game's sound and structure is sound, but it's hard to get over the poor play mechanics and the disappointing graphics.",60
3180,132,2047,14,My initial enthusiasm for the game quickly waned and was snuffed out as I realized that there wasn't much content to the game as the game is limited to just two modes: Tournament and Exhibition.,60
3181,63,2047,14,"It's hard to enjoy a game that offers up so little to let you enjoy it. If you don't understand what I mean, there are only a few modes in this game, none of which carry a great deal of depth.",60
3182,188,2047,14,"All in all, Table Tennis is just too quick, and too cheap port to really get into.",58
3183,386,2047,14,"Table Tennis is infinitely enjoyable in multiplayer, but there is little to do for single players.",58
3184,1,2047,14,"If you don't own an Xbox 360 and you're bored to death with Wii Sports' Tennis, then Table Tennis is worth a look, but the lack of any personality or features -- most notably the missing online support of its predecessor -- just doesn't give it enough gameplay to last much longer than a one-week rental.",55
3185,268,2047,14,Multiplayer is definitely the drawcard of the game and could offer some fun knockout type sessions with a group of friends.,55
3186,279,2047,14,"The thing that really shakes me about Table Tennis, though, is that Rockstar did virtually nothing to spice up the sport. Like I said before, there are no actual players or Career-type mode. There are no power-ups, and no stat improvements. The closest thing to ""technique"" you’ll find is in putting spin on the ball and using your focus meter, which actually doesn’t help very much. In all, Table Tennis is a game that just screams ""lack of effort.""",50
3187,71,2047,14,"Sure, you see the box and you think, “if this is anything like Wii Sports tennis, it’ll be awesome!”, but trust me when I say this is nothing like Wii Sports Tennis. This is everything like every other crappy port the system has received – graphically inferior, feature-poor and suffering from controls that were originally meant for an analog stick but are now shoehorned uncomfortably into nonsensical hand gestures.",40
3188,113,2047,17,"There isn't an annoying or bewildering array of modes because Rockstar had a single-minded ambition to create a game you play with your mates. Play the training modules if you like, but you won't need them. It's that good.",95
3189,118,2047,17,"The game provides the perfect amount of depth mixed with some of the best visuals seen on a console and tops them off a whole lot of fun. At budget price, Table Tennis is a game that should be in every X360 owner’s library.",93
3190,158,2047,17,"Rockstar Games did a fantastic job at creating an authentic ping pong simulator that may even be more appealing than Top Spin for many gamers. With an unparalleled amount of shot control and a meager price tag of only $39.99, there’s no real reason for you to not have a copy of this game already!",92

3193,82,2047,17,"It's the sign of a great sports game when you can't think of anything you'd want to change in the next version. It doesn't need another version...This is brilliant, whichever way you spin it.",90
3194,393,2047,17,"As a pure videogame there's nothing on Microsoft's next-generation format to touch it in terms of instant accessibility, rewarding depth and immensely entertaining and addictive gameplay - maybe it's not a sports sim, but more a spiritual successor to the legendary PONG.",90
3195,440,2047,17,"The bottom line is that while there are not a lot of extra bells and whistles to this title, Rockstar’s Table Tennis is a tremendously fun, fast paced game that’s tough to put down once you get started.",90

3197,267,2047,17,"It’s the perfect zone game, with matches ebbing and flowing as you or your opponent get ‘in the zone’, and the more you play the better you will become. Rockstar Games presents Table Tennisis a perfect example of how a sport should be digitally replicated.",90
3198,9,2047,17,"Without going on about the amazing graphics, the addictive gameplay, and fantastic replayability in the form of unlockable characters and outfits, and of course, the online mode, I'm just going to say two words. Must have.",90

3202,371,2047,17,If you enjoyed those fierce ping pong competitions at summer camp then you owe it to yourself to give Table Tennis a try. Single player is quite challenging and multiplayer matches ought to be considered a spectator sport in itself.,88
3203,307,2047,17,"Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis shows that there is room for focused, small games that do one thing very well. The game is very exciting and will soon have you at the edge of your chair. The game is definitely recommended even if you only have a small interest in it.",88
3204,21,2047,17,"On one hand, you have a game missing the most vital element of any sports game – the career mode. On the other hand, Rockstar has put together a game with great graphics and sound, excellent ball physics and incredible multiplayer options.",88
3205,155,2047,17,"Though it might be lacking in game modes, what is there is done so well that it will keep you playing despite the lack of a drawn out Career Mode.",87
3206,450,2047,17,"A surprise hit. It doesn’t try to offer anything other than what the title indicates, and yet this is exactly why the game succeeds. It doesn’t offer a robust set of playing modes, and instead simply does one thing really well.",87
3207,271,2047,17,"If you ever played ping-pong a day in your life, you will have instant respect for this title. I just wish it had more depth to it.",86

3211,91,2047,17,"Although basic and a little dry when it comes to game modes Table Tennis makes up for with a high level of polish, easy to learn controls, and addictive and fun gameplay.",85
3212,232,2047,17,"Table Tennis not only triumphantly brings a sport comparatively new to gamers to the table (embarrassing pun not intended), but actually manages to wipe the floor with the likes of the disappointing ""Top Spin 2"" into the bargain.",85

3215,325,2047,17,"Pong's fabulously simple gameplay may have been used as a blueprint during Rockstar's development of Table Tennis, but that's certainly a positive attribute and only further enforces the notion of aspiring to create a comparably addictive experience that's completely free of unnecessary padding.",85

3217,179,2047,17,"An undeniably pleasant deviation from all that carjacking and violence, plus the low price-point and focus upon Xbox Live means Table Tennis is certain to carve itself one heck of a niche on 360. [July 2006, p.68]",84
3218,147,2047,17,"Presentation-wise, I think you’ll find a good amount to like here. The sound effects are spot-on, including the way the ball-to-paddle tone will vastly diverge for dramatic effect during a high-count rally. The visuals are a tad on the shiny and plastic look, but nevertheless they’re very well done, with superb lighting, texturing, and animations. Not much to complain about here.",84
3219,108,2047,17,"If you are looking for extensive character development, careers, and complex gameplay in your sports title, then you might want to check out Top Spin 2 or some other game, but if you want to immerse yourself in the best version of pong since…well…pong, then this might just become your new favorite addiction.",84
3220,107,2047,17,"If you enjoy mindless fun and playing games with friends, then Rockstar’s Table Tennis is the right game for you. If Rockstar continues to churn out sports titles, EA and 2K Sports may be ousted from their throne of sports games with gameplay.",84

3224,111,2047,17,"If you do enjoy the challenge of playing other humans and you have an interest in Ping Pong, you should definitely give Rockstar’s Table Tennis a try. You’ll be amazed just how well the game captures the essence of the sport.",82
3225,184,2047,17,"Executing killer spins, tricky drop shots and monster rallies makes Table Tennis a cult-worthy game that breeds unhealthy competition.",80
3226,142,2047,17,"The single-player experience is pretty sparse and really only worth playing to gain more characters, Achievement Points, and practice. Multiplayer is at the core of this game.",80
3227,164,2047,17,"The presentation is uncanny and takes advantage of the Xbox 360, and the gameplay, complete with spins and smashes galore, captures the nature of ping pong and keeps it simple and fun.",80
3228,293,2047,17,One of the most easily accessible games on the Xbox 360.,80
3229,66,2047,17,Table Tennis is about two things: focus and polish. They took a simple game of table tennis and gave it incredible levels of both accessibility and depth.,80
3230,428,2047,17,"Forget preconceptions - Table Tennis is king. While it may be a little empty in terms of structural depth, the hugely addictive gameplay more than makes up for it. Don't let it pass you by. [Issue 7, p.90]",80

3233,413,2047,17,"The only bad thing to say about the game is that it's so entertaining that you want to be able to do more. As a multiplayer game it's an incredible amount of fun, but lone players who can't access Xbox Live will feel a little short changed.",80
3234,354,2047,17,"Its well put together, well finished and is lifelike.",80
3235,291,2047,17,"You can breeze through everything it has to offer in less than a week, which is probably the game’s biggest downfall. However, if you’ve got some friends to enjoy it with, or plan on spending some extensive time on Xbox Live, then the $40 dollar price tag that accompanies Rockstar’s Table Tennis is a steal.",80
3236,419,2047,17,"The game really shines in multiplayer, where the variety in play styles means that every match is different and challenging. Often players will volley well over 30-40 times on each point, which creates some very intense matches that can easily go either way. Whether playing online or against a friend, multiplayer is the best Table Tennis experience by far.",80
3237,31,2047,17,"As such, the game has to be recommended but with certain caveats. Be aware of the skill levels needed to do well in both single player and multiplayer and if I’ve done my job correctly, you have now been well warned. If you have the mettle for the game, you’ll be delighted at what Rockstar has done and you’ll no doubt go on to great things on Xbox Live.",80
3238,67,94,9,"AquaPazza is a charming little fighter that should highly appeal to anime fans and the most hardcore of fighting denizens. Beautiful visuals, catchy music, and a fighting system that perfectly culminates everything Examu has done up to this point.",85
3239,111,94,9,"At $30, it’s a great value and a fine example of a high-quality game being released late in a system’s lifespan.",82
3240,403,94,9,"If you're an anime or Aquaplus fan, this game is pure fanservice on a disc -- but even if you're not, this is still an enjoyable and accessible fighting game, albeit one that lacks a good training mode to ease newcomers into its quirky ways of doing things.",80
3241,204,94,9,"In the end, AquaPazza: AquaPlus Dream Match is a steal for its budget price.",80
3242,41,94,9,"If you are able to look past this saccharine anime flavor, Aquapazza is certainly a well-balanced and interesting fighting game that has been a staple of Japanese arcades for some time now. It will likely have quite the lifetime in American fighting game communities as well.",78
3243,174,94,9,"AquaPazza looks fantastic from a visual perspective, but aside from that it's overall an average fighter.",75
3244,192,94,9,"While AquaPazza may not appeal to the masses right off the bat, if you are a fighting game fan it is certainly worth a try. And for fans of the AquaPlus titles, it should be a no brainer that this game is made just for you.",74
3245,448,94,9,"Even though AquaPazza isn’t the best looking or best playing game on the 2D fighter market, it’s worth a look if you’re in the mood for a weird, albeit entertaining experience.",70
3246,140,94,9,"It's not the most immediately appealing of games, due to its uninteresting character lineup, but digging beneath the surface reveals a solid fighter that's fun to learn and play. It's unlikely to replace some of the bigger, more technical, and prettier fighters as your go-to versus game of choice, but it's a pleasant, enjoyable diversion when you need some airy, unfettered fun.",70
3247,427,94,9,AquaPazza: Aquaplus Dream Match is a fun but very flawed fighting game that resonates most with those who are already proficient in the genre.,70
3248,213,94,9,"While its graphics do little to excite the senses, there’s an interesting fighting game behind them - one that exhibits surprising creativity and variety despite its single-minded emphasis on offense.",70

3250,120,94,9,"Despite its quasi-anonymous, unknown status, AquaPazza is a surprisingly accomplished 2D brawler with a great mix of proficient fighting and fanservice. It’s more than worthy of consideration.",70
3251,68,548,8,"Devil May Cry 3's music, a cross between hardcore heavy metal and techno, enhances the dark tale. In between missions, there is spooky whispering that sounds like what you'd imagine an Ozzy Osbourne record being played backward would be like.",100
3252,390,548,8,"Decent graphics that hold up smoothly in the height of fighting, plus atmospheric cut-scenes, great locations and superb sound effects all measure up to a memorable, if utterly exhausting, experience.",100
3253,354,548,8,"The best action game on the current generation of systems; it has everything you could ever want in such a title within the genre – including the most important facet of all, depth – and lots of it too.",100
3254,213,548,8,"It has five difficulty settings (all challenging, most insane), plenty of secret missions, unlockable bonuses and costumes, an easy to use interface, and more brain-twisting puzzles than the first two games combined. In other words, it's the reason you bought a PlayStation 2.",96
3255,187,548,8,Devil May Cry 3 Dante's Awakening will bring action fans to their knees.,96
3256,263,548,8,"Definitely one of the best games on the PS2. With excellent gameplay and graphics, Capcom has greatly raised the bar in the action genre.",94
3257,108,548,8,"It has everything a good action game should have: mind-blowingly awesome action, gameplay that is a blast, beautiful and unique graphics, an interesting storyline that engages the imagination, and a charming and likeable hero that remains interesting, even if he’s a bit clichéd.",93
3258,30,548,8,"I’m still kind of miffed that you don’t get your Devil Trigger abilities until about halfway into the game, but when you do get it, it’s worth it.",92

3261,229,548,8,"DMC3 is bigger, better, more badass, and more fun then the first one and gives you some back-story for the first game in a way... Just make sure that you have someone to cry to when the same boss beats you repeatedly for the last half hour, because believe me it will happen.",91
3262,188,548,8,"The game is less about story, experience or ambience and more about mastering the artful techniques and challenges presented by the game. It's a very time-consuming, frustrating but rewarding and unique experience.",91

3264,110,548,8,"Offering improvements that add a brand new dimension to the combo-driven demon meat carving, this title takes the concept of a hardcore action experience and contorts it into a humiliating position before administering a handgun enema...

3265,132,548,8,"Having to worry about more than button mashing is something new for Devil May Cry, and it can make things tricky in the beginning--even on the easiest level, you'll need to fight intelligently from the start or you'll die a quick, painful death.",90

3268,288,548,8,"Capcom took the formula that worked so well for the original Devil May Cry and added depth with new techniques that work incredibly well given the way enemies act in the game. This—plus the excellent cut-scenes, amazing backgrounds, and great character models—proves DMC 3 is a worthy successor to Dante's original adventure.",90

3273,317,548,8,"The addition of the style system, a concrete storyline and a slick new arsenal of moves makes this entry arguably the best in the series so far. However, don't be mistaken, Devil May Cry 3 is hard as hell.",90

3291,142,548,8,"A superlative action game with an absurdly high difficulty level. That's just the long and short of it, and this may be good or bad depending on your disposition. Personally, I found it equal parts satisfying and frustrating.",80
3292,99,548,8,"It's nowhere near as groundbreaking or accessible as the impeccable ""Resident Evil 4"", but when you look at other PS2 action game releases this year like ""Tenchu"" or ""Nanobreaker"" you see just how far above average this game is.",80

3303,108,2707,2,Without a doubt the finest handheld version of the franchise you can currently play. It might even be one of the top five DS games released to date.,92
3304,188,2707,2,"Another amazing release by Vicarious Visions. One where they have not only gone all out with their effort, but have pushed what we can expect out of the system. It is easily one of the best titles to be released on the system thus far.",91
3305,280,2707,2,"What differentiates Tony Hawk's American Sk8land from ""Mario Kart"" is the level of involvement. Sk8land is far less pick-up-and-play, but those who take the time to learn its intricacies will have a blast.",91
3306,142,2707,2,"Definitely the best DS game to date that has been produced by non-Japanese developers. The single-player story mode is goofy and fun, classic mode rocks, and the online multiplayer serves as a standard for what future DS WiFi games should use for their website/DS integration.",90
3307,279,2707,2,"It may be the best looking DS game yet, and it matches the console experience to a degree that you'd expect only on the PSP.",90
3308,62,2707,2,"An excellent mix of single and multiplayer options, and online gameplay that will force DS developers to try real hard to beat it.",90
3309,111,2707,2,"A monster of a package. I was expecting a cheap tie-in game and ended up playing one of the best titles that the DS has to offer, and one of the better games in the Tony Hawk series. Marvelous.",90
3310,448,2707,2,"With the addition of true online play, content download, and some creative touch screen use this is certainly one of the better games available right now for Nintendo’s handheld wonder.",90
3311,192,2707,2,"It's rare to see a quality console-to-portable translation, but Vicarious Visions pulls it off with flying colors. A fresh new art style, mildly intriguing story, rock-solid classic modes and a stellar multiplayer component launch American Sk8land to superstardom on the DS.",90
3312,147,2707,2,"One of the most impressive handheld versions of the Tony Hawk series to come to the portable gaming format, Tony Hawk’s American Sk8land is a true thrasher classic.",89
3313,213,2707,2,"Even though it’s a been there, done that experience, Tony Hawk’s American Sk8land still a fun, frantic, and fantastic design that works extraordinarily well on the handheld due to its pick-up-and-play, quick-shot construction.",88
3314,110,2707,2,"To put it simply, Sk8Land is a no-brainer for Tony Hawk fans with a DS. [Feb 2006, p.112]",88
3315,265,2707,2,"A great DS game. The short and relatively easy story mode is still a blast to play through, and the other modes make it a fun game.",86
3316,450,2707,2,"This is a great representation of the series, with very attractive visuals and a robust collection of maps and tricks, and it’s pretty amazing that Vicarious Visions managed to turn this one around so handily.",85
3317,140,2707,2,"Its novel look, its online play, solid gameplay, and its revamped goals make this a great one for the Nintendo DS.",84
3318,195,2707,2,"It is a solid game with only a few issues, and is deserving of a purchase.",83
3319,19,2707,2,"The perfect kind of portable title -- while it's based off a console game, the unique visual style alone makes it worthwhile to own both.",83
3320,406,2707,2,"Though the touch screen gameplay in Sk8land isn’t as intuitive as it should be, Vicarious Visions hit all the other bases of a good Tony Hawk title.",81
3321,278,2707,2,"Aside from a few minor issues, though, Vicarious Visions had done a fantastic job creating a faithful and fun Hawk game. [Jan 2006, p.112]",80
3322,82,2707,2,"A really solid rendition of what made those early Tony Hawk games great, but on your faithful friend, the DS. It's smart and sassy, and it looks far better than you could possibly expect.",80
3323,293,2707,2,"American Sk8land manages to create a feeling of fun that has been missing from recent Tony Hawk titles, by focusing on pure skating, rather than mischief.",80
3324,115,2707,2,"It's nice to spend a few minutes getting some goals knocked out while waiting for the bus, and while the world may be tiring of Hawk style, now you can have a respectable version in your pocket.",75
3325,136,2707,2,"The game has a 100 percent pure Tony Hawk pedigree. For gamers looking for more innovative experiences for their innovative little system, it probably should be a rental-before-purchase situation.",75
3326,68,2707,2,"I didn't want to put this game down. I took it with me in the car, in my room, everywhere. Wiping out and failing goals only made me want to play more.",75
3327,389,2707,2,"The Touch Screen is both used and abused, offering a few poorly executed trick concepts and a slew of customization options for the creative artist in all of us.",70
3328,427,2707,2,Sk8land is the best attempt yet to convert the old boy of skateboarding to a portable.,70
3329,63,2707,2,"The developers went back to the core ideals of the franchise, and came out with what made it fun, and fully customized to really shine on the DS.",70
3330,184,2707,2,"Tiny DS buttons make tight and efficient combos downright painful, and unless you set your sights on buffing your skater’s speed stats from the get-go, the pokey pace of play will put you to sleep.",70
3331,186,2707,2,"There's enough levels to provide a bit of variety to the single player modes but multiplayer is definitely where it's at, and always has been.",70
3332,307,2707,3,"American Sk8land is a better game, but only marginally so it isn't really worth the price of admission unless you're a hardcore Tony Hawk fan.",77
3333,147,2707,3,"A nice little program that really brings little new to the series as a whole, other than supplying gamers with a seamless environment.",70
3334,108,2707,3,"SK8Land seems to have all of the right ingredients that should make for an awesome handheld Hawk experience - but for some reason, the final product just is not all that engaging.",70
3335,271,2707,3,American SK8Land doesn't quite capture the magic of its console brethren.,68
3336,195,2707,3,"The game simply is lacking in the fun factor and dosen't hold your attention long enough to make you really want to play it. There's also a complete lack of immersion partially due to the paper-thin plotline, the generic sound and the minimalistic graphics.",61
3337,278,2707,3,"This game brings nothing worth mentioning to the franchise, and almost feels like a step backward. [Jan 2006, p.116]",60
3338,140,2707,3,"Sk8land looks slick and controls like a Tony Hawk game should, but its skate park designs are weak and its story mode missions lack creativity.",60
3339,148,1817,14,"What's more yummy than an Action RPG that uses well the recipes of Zelda, Rygar and Castlevania combined? Something that does just that and more, a game that is a surprise for Nintendo, a true mature story of illness and love, a dark, and deep tale wrapped in old-school game design.",90
3340,5,1817,14,"It's not as monumental as Xenoblade Chronicles but nonetheless you experience an exciting and moving adventure. It quotes the likes of Shadow of the Colossus, Castlevania and Zelda but is able to stand on its own two feet.",85
3341,157,1817,14,"Pandora’s Tower may not be remembered as fondly as other games in the Wii’s lineup, and it feels a bit dated right out of the gate, but I couldn’t think of a better third party sendoff for the Wii.",85
3342,262,1817,14,Pandora's Tower is some kind of a perfect example of what a small Japanese developer should do: a niche product with many interesting qualities and some kind of innovation to a starving genre. Some control issues and a disappointing graphical engine are the lows of an overall recommended game.,82
3343,179,1817,14,"Clumsy it may be, but this is the perfect pick-me-up for Wii owners with post-Skyloft blues. [May 2012, p.85]",81
3344,255,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower is one of the most interesing action-RPG games for the Wii, an atractive quest to rescue a beauty and defenceless woman who is cursed. Ganbarion developed a game with hardcore gamers in mind that fits perfect in your collection if you bought Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story.",80
3345,171,1817,14,Quotation forthcoming.,80
3346,55,1817,14,"Many will look at Pandora's Tower as being the weakest of the three Wii RPGs, with Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story easily making Ganbarion and Nintendo's effort seem unworthy of attention. However, such a judgement would be unjust, since this Action RPG takes a totally different slant, offering an almost 3D Castlevania and Metroid feel to proceedings, mixing in a pleasant love story and a brilliantly smooth battle system that will widen its appeal.",80
3347,82,1817,14,"It's a slightly old-school adventure with a vibe reminiscent of Castlevania (especially the PlayStation 2 sequels). But while those games under-delivered on a compelling world with a consistent structure, Pandora's Tower will draw you in and make you care.",80
3348,408,1817,14,"Playing it makes us remember classics like Castlevania or even Ico, but Pandora's Tower has a strong and charming personality and it is a pleasant surprise. It will engage and entertain most players, especially those who are looking for an adventure like this one, but other players may find the game a bit repetitive.",80
3349,83,1817,14,Pandora´s Tower is a game that takes its time to reveal its own charm and qualities.,80
3350,140,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower is an exciting, chain-swinging race against time to save your beloved from a beastly fate.",80
3351,365,1817,14,Pandora's Tower is the last great title of the Wii cycle. A good action rpg that mixes a lot of different features from different games. If Ganbarion Studios was more careful about some technical issues and put more effort into pushing the limits of the hardware we would have one of the best game of the current generation.,80
3352,320,1817,14,Pandora's Tower is a fun action adventure in an interesting world. Too bad the level design can get a bit monotonous and the main characters lack a lot of charisma. [May 2012],80
3353,89,1817,14,"The release of Pandora's Tower will probably be the last in Nintendo Wii's history. After Xenoblade and The Last Story, the circle is closed, with all the three oriental RPGs out. It may not be equally epic or wonderfully told, but still it's an enjoyable game.",80
3354,374,1817,14,"With an excellent time-management mechanic, some great dungeon design and an emotive love story at its heart, Pandora's Tower is an action-RPG well worth checking out.",80
3355,210,1817,14,"There's an overwhelming sense of melancholy and dread as well as a real element of body horror. [July 2012, p.68]",80
3356,240,1817,14,Smart and colorful action RPG offers not only a romantic story line but adds innovation in the progressing illness of the main heroine. [June 2012],80
3357,67,1817,14,"A bittersweet end to the Wii's life: a taste of the kind of software that could have carried the console during those slow months. As it stands, it won't be anything more that an engaging action RPG with a clever hook. But I suppose I can live with that.",80
3358,204,1817,14,"It’s hard to think of another Big N game that has its heroine munching on monster flesh, so here’s hoping that Nintendo recognizes what a fantastic action-roleplaying experience they missed localizing and gives stateside players more of this kind of mature title in the future.",80
3359,233,1817,14,"What it does offer, though, is enough to warrant a recommendation, namely its fun dungeons, great bosses, an enjoyable chain-flinging gimmick, and emotional warmth in the relationship between Aeron and Elena.",80
3360,391,1817,14,"It’s rare to see a compelling hack-and-slash dungeon crawler work as well as Pandora’s Tower, but this game needs to wear its accomplishments proudly. You very well may never go back to your Wii after this transition between console generations.",80
3361,348,1817,14,"Much like Elena in the throes of disfiguration, Pandora's Tower is imperfect, but begging to be loved.",80
3362,197,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower got its weaknesses, but the wonderful soundtrack, the grotesque atmosphere and the dynamic relationship with Helena offer a great deal of fun.",79
3363,4,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower is an Action RPG with a pleasant love story and a brilliantly smooth battle system. A good game for wii, no doubt.",78
3364,430,1817,14,"Developer Ganbarion shows it has a lot of talent and great vision, yet not enough to turn Pandora's Tower into a great game. The story and bossfights do make this a fun experience, but the combat lacks depth and the camera is occasionally uncooperative.",75
3365,268,1817,14,"The developing relationship between Aeron and Elena is a truly enjoyable one, and it is interesting to watch how the flashbacks Elena gets after eating the Master flesh start to shed light on the mystery of why she was cursed in the first place.",75
3366,280,1817,14,"This is a game full of gambles, and most don't pay off the way you might expect. There are as many triumphs as there are failures, and it's almost like it's cursed by its own design. It certainly won't be to everyone's tastes– you'll either love it or you'll hate it– but if you can look past its flaws, there's still plenty of enjoyment to be found underneath.",75
3367,145,1817,14,Pandora's Tower isn't the best-playing action RPG out there. Its fixed camera and control issues are often quite frustrating. Yet these issues aren't enough to completely outweigh Elena's convincing character.,72
3368,285,1817,14,This is an average-to-good hack and slash that is unfortunately hobbled by some off-the-shelf RPG elements and a well-meaning - if ultimately tiresome - girlfriend management system.,70
3369,213,1817,14,"Even given the irresistible pull of the narrative, Pandora's Tower isn't quite up to the standard of other recent Wii RPGs. Yet if at times it seems ugly, confused and repetitive, at others it's creative, gripping and wonderfully atmospheric.",70
3370,264,1817,14,"A very solid, fast-paced action romp with islands of greatness in a sea of repetitive combat. Still, there are surprisingly few better Castlevania alternatives on Wii to this day.",70
3371,277,1817,14,"This title has much to recommend it, as long as you're willing to look beyond some of its faults.",70
3372,451,1817,14,"Between well-designed dungeons, thrilling boss battles and a compelling hook in Elena's deteriorating condition, Pandora's Tower is a unique treat for those still loyal to the Wii.",70
3373,84,1817,14,"Solid hack-and-slash mechanics and classic RPG elements for this entertaining action game, that unfortunately is also one of the worst-looking Wii titles up to date.",70
3374,230,1817,14,"Ganbarion, the creators of the most famous fighting games on DS, are back with Pandora's Tower, an action-RPG that will seduce those who loves great adventure.",70
3375,86,1817,14,"While Last Story reflects the emotional and narrative side of H. Sakaguchi, Pandora's Tower is more offensive and closes a large cycle of production for Nintendo Wii.",70
3376,181,1817,14,"A mature RPG that's been suffering from bad technical quality, repeating of the same in-game situations and from the excessively fast monster respawn. If you manage to get over these flaws, you are going to be rewarded with nice gameplay, a well-made motion control system and especially with its emotional story with five different endings.",70
3377,279,1817,14,"In some respects, Pandora's Tower shares similarities with Shadow of the Colossus, and while it doesn't ascend to the high barometer of that game, it is worthy of the comparison.",70
3378,115,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower is an enjoyable RPG, and if the Affinity thing wasn't involved, I'd easily put this up to the ranks of four stars and beyond. There's a lot of exploring to do, puzzles to solve, and great action that requires serious thinking. The gameplay as well as the presentation are top-shelf. If you can put up with Elena, in either form, you'll find this to be a great action adventure title.",70
3379,77,1817,14,"The last of the “Operation Rainfall Three,” Pandora’s Tower borrows heavily from Shadow of the Colossus—young lad must rescue his beloved from a gruesome fate by felling massive beasts—but you can’t help but think you’ve played a far better version of this game before. Hardcore Japanese RPG fans might forgive some of the glaring flaws here, but Pandora’s Tower certainly won’t have the mass appeal of Team Ico’s 2005 PS2 classic.",65
3380,257,1817,14,"There are some clever ideas at work here, particularly the hero's primary weapon, but a lack of gameplay refinement and bland storytelling fail to make the most of it.",60
3381,78,1817,14,"A little slicker, and Pandora's Tower could have provided a surprisingly effective alternative in the character-action genre. Its blend of pointer controls and button-based combat begs to be further explored. But as it is, this a clunky action title – albeit one with a flicker of genuine emotion at its heart.",60
3382,129,1817,14,"With an identity of its own, some clever ideas and a well written story, Pandora's Tower can be quite charming. On the downside, some of its gameplay mechanics simply don't work.",60
3383,350,1817,14,"It's cast from a different mould than that of Xenoblade and The Last Story, and while it may not reach the same level as its contemporaries, those looking for a decent adventure should find plenty to like.",60
3384,110,1817,14,"Ganbarion went out of its way to craft a title that experiments with interesting ideas. Unfortunately, none of its unique elements are refined enough to be successful, making it impossible for me to cheer for this underdog.",60
3385,336,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower is loaded with interesting concepts, but it fails to pull them through an entire playthrough in a sustainable, engaging way.",55
3386,151,1817,14,"Pandora's Tower doesn't offer anything appealing or unique, and is not a Wii title that will find a home with many gamers.",50
3387,142,963,8,"How could God of War II possibly live up to the successes of its predecessor? The answer, my friends, is astonishing, because GoW II completely eclipses its forefather by adding even more of the stuff that we loved, namely: blood, puzzles, cinematic presentation and fifteen minute long combos.",100
3388,132,963,8,"No review can truly capture the magnificence of God of War II. There are memorable moments galore, the kind that you'll try in vain to describe to your friends but words can't fully do justice to this game.",100
3389,376,963,8,The sense of scale is off the charts. From the opening brawl with the towering Colossus of Rhodes to the Island of Creation—a sprawling mega-level which takes a good half of the game to traverse—God Of War II's venue doesn't feel mortal for even a moment.,100
3390,446,963,8,"God of War II is the strongest game to hit the PS2 this year, and should be high on the list of best games on the system, period.",100

3392,395,963,8,"If I remember right, the last game I gave a 10 to was ""ICO."" GOWII is that caliber. It's polished, infinitely satisfying, offers a ton of replayability and bonus content, and is just plain fun to play. That is a 10 game to me.",100
3393,451,963,8,"As we begin to plan our eulogies for a truly superb console, how fitting it is that Sony delivers its final and finest offering. [Apr 2007, p.110]",100

3395,174,963,8,"A masterpiece of action gaming. Story, production values, gameplay, ... it’s the whole package, and it runs just beautifully on the PS3 too in case you’re interested. Unless you absolutely hate action gamers, you’ll absolutely love God of War II.",100
3396,136,963,8,"God of War 2 brings back all the things that made the first game such a huge hit, including an incredible battle right at the start of the game to set the pace for the rest of the way.",100

3399,110,963,8,"While the story issues and a slight ""I’ve done this before"" factor stop it just short of perfection, God of War II is a title you simply cannot miss. It never stopped being one of the best games I’ve ever played.",98
3400,316,963,8,"Not only the best action/adventure game ever to grace the Playstation 2, but also one of the most amazing gaming experiences of the entire generation, and one that should not be missed by anyone who can handle the extreme violence and sexual content.",98
3401,213,963,8,God of War II may in fact be the best action game ever made. It outdoes the original God of War in every way.,97
3402,51,963,8,You simply won't find a more satisfying single player experience on the PS2.,97
3403,307,963,8,"It doesn’t reinvent the wheel but for some 12 hours we’re seeing tighter, nimbler combat, fantastic level designs, and great gameplay. GOW II is undoubtedly better than its prequel and ultimately one of the best games on any last generation console.",97
3404,325,963,8,"As action games go GOWII certainly has one of the most elegantly plotted and skilfully woven stories ever, perfectly mining its mythological setting to deliver an experience full of all the delightful twists, awe inspiring set pieces and huge battles that you'd hoped for.",97
3405,41,963,8,"The game's pace is quicker than the first so you might finish it quickly, but like the first title there are tons of unlockable content, including new levels of difficulty and costumes.",96
3406,193,963,8,"With all the attention directed to the next-gen systems, here comes a game that shows that the PS2 is still the baddest boy on the block and probably will be for a good while.",96
3407,232,963,8,"It’s brutal, beautiful and brilliant. God of War 2 gives gamers more of exactly what’s wanted: unashamedly blood-thirsty combat, an epic storyline and one badass anti-hero who doesn’t say anything without shouting it. You’re doing your PS2 a disservice if you don’t see it out with God of War 2.",96
3408,1,963,8,"There are a few brilliant core improvements, such as the beautifully implemented grappling system that lets you swing around with your blades. But for the most part, the game's best features are context-specific things rather than features that change or improve the title as a whole...A stellar example of what can be done when a developer focuses on telling a story and lets that drive the game.",95
3409,147,963,8,"It's not just <I>one</I> element that turned the game into a masterpiece, it's <I>every</I> element – the controls (perfection), world design (unbelievably creative), combat (exciting and challenging), and enemy selection (unreal) are just a few of the reasons why this is PS2’s best first-party release.",95
3410,145,963,8,"For every video game system there's a piece of software that defines its capabilities. God of War II is that game. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end, and one of those experiences that will cause you to hunker down, turn off your phone, and check out of reality for a few days.",95
3411,165,963,8,"The first God of War was never about deep, involving combat -- it was about solving puzzles, having an entertaining classical setting and hacking your way through hordes of enemies. God of War II continues the tradition, but improves in just about every area.",95
3412,204,963,8,"Simply put, God of War II is as good as it gets on the Playstation 2. [Apr 2007, p.44]",95
3413,179,963,8,"Critics might wonder that if GoW2 turned out this good, imagine what it would have been like on PS3...yet in resisting the lure of all that next-gen horsepower Sony Santa Monica have instead crafted a sequel that somehow - amazingly - coaxes out every last drop of PS2 juice to create a fitting testament to the system. Astonishing. [Apr 2007, p.78]",95

3417,195,963,8,"Not many games reach this level of polish and immersion. The brutal action, the fantastic sound and voice work, the incredible cutscenes, and the well-crafted storyline makes for a complete package that rivals any game you’ll find on the shelf.",94
3418,194,963,8,"The depth of combat rivals a fighting game, while the story will keep players glued to the screen. Couple that with the high production values that God of War 2 has and you get what is perhaps the last great jewel in the PS2 crown.",94
3419,235,963,8,"God of War II is an amazing game and has everything from great graphics and great sound, to fun combat and an exciting story that make this one of the most epic titles in a long time.",94

3423,107,963,8,"Accompanying all of the great gameplay and astounding visuals is an amazing score. The music behind God of War II is as epic as any other component, and it serves to make the game a much more intense and immersive experience.",93
3424,50,963,8,"GoW II proves that you don't need £400-worth of technology to make a fantastic game, as Kratos' second outing is more intense and rewarding than anything we've played last- or current-gen.",93
3425,118,963,8,The graphics of GoW II are just as beautiful as ever with some of the best art direction in a game to date.,92
3426,140,963,8,"Simply put, it's easily one of the best action adventure games of the last console generation, and it even trumps much of what has been shown in the current generation.",92
3427,80,963,8,"That the game manages to both come to a satisfying conclusion and still make it clear that Kratos' adventure is far from over is quite a feat and a lesson that other action-game developers could learn something from. [Apr 2007, p.90]",92
3428,320,963,8,"A spectacular, overly aggressive and a thoroughly entertaining rollercoaster ride - just what one would expect. The ""more bosses, less ordinary ballet"" attitude is a double-edged sword, but does not stop the game from delivering an experience almost as good as the original did. [Apr 2007]",92
3429,190,963,8,It does what it does best – quick amazing action with great graphics and fun gameplay.,92
3430,111,963,8,God of War II begins with a bang louder than a falling Kraken and does not let up for the next dozen or so hours you will spend engrossed in its mythos.,92
3431,115,963,8,"God of War II has its weaknesses, but its strengths are unparalleled. This is yet another bloody, tasty, tough piece of code made flesh from Sony, and we can’t wait for another helping. Don’t listen to Nietzsche, this God is alive and kicking ass.",91
3432,59,963,8,The movie style production values from the visuals to the voice acting to the sound and story were far above anything I would expect out of a PS2 game.,91
3433,155,963,8,"Audibly speaking, the game, like the first one, is nearly flawless. The voice work is executed with such grace that they make you feel as if these characters are believable and a part of the time period.",91
3434,123,963,8,"Sony's masterpiece, God of War II, not only trumps its prequel, but also redefines the action adventure genre...Not only does it cement the PS2's amazing legacy, it delivers one of the best gaming experiences in the video game history.",90
3435,427,963,8,"It adheres very strongly to the concept of, ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it,"" perhaps to the point of excess. It is a well-designed game, with terrific level design and a smooth, excellent combat system, but it also doesn't particularly bring anything dramatically different to the field.",90
3436,419,963,8,"Aside from a few frustrating spikes in difficulty and a slower-paced final act, God Of War II is about as perfect an action game as you could ever hope for, and a worthy sequel to one of the PlayStation 2’s crown jewels.",90
3437,132,2400,1,"The tired, princess-saving formula never seems to change, but somehow Nintendo makes every visit to the Mushroom Kingdom feel like the first time.",100
3438,188,2400,1,"I'm literally floored by how much I enjoyed it, and I find it quickly rising in the ranks as one of my favorite Super Mario titles.",100
3439,259,2400,1,"Is it more imaginative than Super Mario Galaxy? No. Will it revolutionize gaming like Super Mario 64. Hardly. Do either of these questions matter? Absolutely not, and don't let anyone prove otherwise. Super Mario 3D Land is the epitome of fun. Most importantly, it's a shining example of everything that's good and wholesome about video games.",100
3440,374,2400,1,"The charm, inventiveness and knowing nods to Mario heritage bring constant smiles, and it's not only a superb Mario game but a fantastic advert for the hardware it appears on. A perfect starting point for newcomers to the series, or a nostalgic throwback for Mario die-hards that still manages to be incredibly contemporary. Whichever category you fall into, one thing's for sure; handheld platforming simply does not get better than this.",100
3441,115,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land is one of the best Mario games in recent memory. It's better than New Super Mario Bros. and just about on par with Galaxy. A few months back I stated that Ocarina of Time 3D was the premier reason to own a 3DS. That is no longer the case. Mario is still Nintendo's man to move hardware, even if he is a bit late to the party.",100
3442,148,2400,1,"A platformer of great quality, visually stunning, and offering an interesting architecture filled with funny and interesting details making a brilliant use of the stereoscopic 3D. It sure is a little too easy for the most part, probably because of it wants to remain as accessible as possible, making its first few levels a walk in the park for the fan, but its charms work nonetheless. It's hard to look elsewhere once you started diving into its worlds, before actually finishing them entirely... as expected, it's a must-have of the platform.",100
3443,72,2400,1,"Mario's best handheld game in years, and even when put up against his acclaimed console offerings, it's yet another sublime adventure crammed with surprises and smiles every few minutes. It's also perhaps the first 3DS title that makes the screen an integral part of the game rather than an eye-catching afterthought.",100
3444,202,2400,1,The meticulous craft that has gone into its ingenious design is enough to warrant admiration from even those players who have no time for the portly plumber. As for the rest of you – and we're assuming you're Mario fans – you're in for a real treat.,100
3445,88,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land is a perfect blend between the new and the old. It's a near perfect piece of Nintendo entertainment and the best game in the series since the masterpiece Super Mario 64.,100
3446,136,2400,1,"There's no question – if you own a 3DS, this is the best game on the platform, and instantly worthy of a purchase. It's one of the best portable platformers I've ever played (and I've had my fair share), and an almost shockingly good Mario title on any platform.",100
3447,268,2400,1,It's the best game on the 3DS and it justifies the purchase of the system all by itself.,98
3448,110,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land isn't perfect, but the few complaints I have (like the lack of variety in boss fights and some re-hashed levels) can't bring down this entertaining mix of nostalgia and innovation. &#65279;It lives up to the level of quality set by previous entries and is easily the best reason to own a 3DS.",95
3449,213,2400,1,"With an expertly balanced difficulty progression, dazzling level design and masterful Power-Ups, this is the ideal 3DS experience...As a whole, 3D Land is brilliant and addictive, and should do for 3D-enhanced platforming what the original Super Mario Bros. did for 2D platforming. If you own a 3DS system, you have no choice - you simply must own this game.",95
3450,279,2400,1,"EAD Tokyo's 3DS debut is marvelous, and filled with almost endless creativity.",95
3451,262,2400,1,"It's not just the killer application the 3DS was waiting for, it's also one of the most enjoyables platformers in years, filled with creative ideas and offering a perfect balance between tradition and innovation.",95
3452,404,2400,1,"Everyone wanted to know where Mario would go after conquering the universe (twice) on the Wii, and with this new adventure, Nintendo gave the answer. To alternate dimensions? No. To home.",95
3453,111,2400,1,3D Land delivers an experience that will satisfy long-time fans of the franchise while also making it accessible enough for newcomers to enjoy.,95
3454,62,2400,1,"A fantastic platforming title that uses 3D in gaming ways that no other title has yet to do. Classic costumes like the Tanooki and Hammer Bros. suits make appearances, and easy to earn extra lives make this accessible by all age groups.",95
3455,70,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land proves that there is still an innovative direction that platforming can take even after the constant innovation seen throughout the history of Mario. This game may not be as creative as Galaxy (really what is?) but the different camera perspectives and depth based gameplay, along with all sorts of platforming styles meshed into one game make for a worthy Mario title for the 3DS.",94
3456,285,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land is superb. The care and attention put into every aspect of it is beyond words and the only real problem point - the difficulty - is blown away by its remarkable post-credits reveal. This is the first truly essential, completely new title for the 3DS.",94
3457,145,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land proves that gaming's most enduring mascot is also its most adaptable.,92
3458,197,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land is a great mix of all mario games. Nintendo managed to combine some well-known elements with new features and the result is great. It is the best 3DS game on the market so far.,91
3459,195,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land is the first 3DS title that really takes advantage of the 3D capabilities of the system.,91
3460,280,2400,1,"While it may not be quite the evolutionary leap forward that Super Mario Galaxy was, Super Mario 3D Land is still a vital installment in the long-running franchise.",91
3461,320,2400,1,Less intergalactic and more linear – but still works wonders. 3D Land is the first 3DS game that doesn't put in question the benefit of turning on the 3D slider. The only major critisism can be placed on the lack of difficulty before moving on to the special stages. [Dec 2011],91
3462,278,2400,1,"Really though, Super Mario 3D Land is a triple-A title, and as good a reason as you'll ever have for picking up a Nintendo 3DS if you haven't already. [Nov 2011, p.70]",90
3463,277,2400,1,"It's impossible not to be impressed by the vast number of classic Super Mario elements that have been squeezed into the package, especially given how fresh they all look and feel in their new 3D presentation. If you've been looking for a reason to pick up a 3DS, you've just found it.",90
3464,233,2400,1,"And while it takes a while to build up, and lacks the rich variety of secrets you know from games like Mario 3 and Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D Land eventually becomes a demandingly hardcore, addictive platformer. It's also easily the most beautiful game on the 3DS, and one of the best-looking Mario games.",90
3465,425,2400,1,"3D Land is a grabby borrower of a game - enemies from Mario 3, music from 2006's New Super Mario Bros., gameplay from Galaxy. Eventually it starts borrowing from itself. It's an excellent game because all of these things work so well together; the only thing keeping it from perfection is that it cries out for more innovations to call its own.",90
3466,184,2400,1,"Though it falls slightly short compared to other Mario titles (aka some of the greatest games ever made), it's certainly a release worthy of the character's legacy. It expertly builds on franchise history, has tons of clever ideas, and even with the rare control hang-ups, it stands tall in the realm of 3D platformers, especially compared to the paltry library of games the 3DS currently has.",90
3467,413,2400,1,"A step back and a leap forward. As a gateway drug for those reluctant to embrace Mario in three dimensions, Super Mario 3D Land should be a huge success.",90
3468,82,2400,1,"You could wish for 3D Land to be a little more challenging in places, then, but you couldn't wish for it to be any denser, any more imaginative, or any more daring. Most importantly, you couldn't wish for it to be any more playful.",90
3469,415,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land is indeed a wonderful debut on Nintendo 3DS. The 3D effect is fine and helpful because of some camera issues. Mario fans will love this new experience because of the very cool retro elements.,90
3470,50,2400,1,"Conflicted throughout, but still an undeniable 3DS achievement. Wait for it to get its act together and the game soars. Well, flutters.",90
3471,378,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land is a great platformer with lots of gameplay and fantastic visuals, slightly overshadowed by some awkward camera issues.",90
3472,334,2400,1,Time to dust off that 3DS and let Mario do what he does best - Super Mario 3D Land is pure entertainment from start to finish.,90
3473,427,2400,1,Super Mario 3D Land is easy to recommend as a must-have game for any 3DS owner's library.,90
3474,171,2400,1,Nostalgia and new features come together in a lovely platform game that will put a smile on your face.,90
3475,264,2400,1,"A brilliant entry into the much loved series, it's just a shame it has to end so soon.",90
3476,170,2400,1,"A pleasure to play, pure Mario of the highest caliber. Doesn't quite reach the heights of the amazing Super Mario Galaxy 2, but still an excellent platformer, and a must have for 3DS owners.",90
3477,255,2400,1,"This game is very much inspired by Super Mario Galaxy, and that's fantastic! Over 100 levels, many challenges, variety and costumes, especially the Tanooki dress. Put the 3D effect to the fullest and enjoy. This game is designed for that. It's the best 3DS exclusive to date.",90
3478,84,2400,1,"1/4 of Super Mario Bros. + 2/4 of Super Mario 64 + 1/4 of Mario Galaxy... add a little bit of 3D, mix together and serve cold. Tasty!",90
3479,124,2400,1,"There's a lot to like about Super Mario 3D Land. It's easily the best 3D title that's graced the 3DS to date, and shows that there is so much potential in the handheld.",90
3480,89,2400,1,"Super Mario 3D Land is surely peculiar among the series' episodes, mixing elements of classic and modern gameplay. It's not another Galaxy, and it just doesn't want to be: it has a strong identity, made of a great level design and rewarding gameplay. And it's incredibly fun to play.",90
3481,179,2400,1,"Brings the magic world of the 2D Marios to life like no other, but blink and you'll miss it. [Christmas 2011, p.68]",90
3482,293,2400,1,"Inventive, beautiful and dangerously addictive, Super Mario 3D Land is the 3DS defining game, capitalising on the system's strengths and value of portability, while recalling the best qualities of both 2D and 3D iterations of the franchise. Not to be missed.",90
3483,246,2400,1,"An excellent title that is tailor made specifically to use the capabilities that the 3DS provides. Impeccable use of 3D, brilliant level design and diverse environments and stages are all reasons why the game is such an enjoyable experience.",90
3484,157,2400,1,"Words cannot stress how great Mario 3D Land really is. Although I would have liked to have seen a handful of concepts expanded, 3D Land does pretty much everything right: if you're looking for a new Mario game, this is it.",90
3485,389,2400,1,"A game for everyone, young or old, casual or hardcore. It's an easy game to get into and an easy game to latch onto. The levels are inventive, colorful and varied, constantly providing a new experience at each turn. It's a fun, polished game, but then it's a Mario, and I'd have expected nothing less.",90
3486,64,2400,1,"Nintendo have given us something for everyone, an easy game for the youngsters and newcomers, which is hiding a serious old school hard platformer behind it for all us old grizzled gamers.",90

3488,1,2766,8,"The frustration many hit during punishing sections in this sort of game is never allowed to develop.

3492,307,2766,8,"The game's graphics are charming and colorful, and certainly very child-friendly. The many levels you'll find are of a respectable size and with many things to do, but in pure technical terms, none of this will ""wow"" an experienced gamer.",76

3494,420,2766,8,"It is rare to find anything that can hold a five year olds attention for more then 20 minutes; well, Ty2 repeated the first installment's rapture. The game is actually too hard for her, but she kept trying till she could get no farther, then it became mine to play.",72
3495,142,2766,8,"Though getting through Ty 2 is particularly easy, it would likely be enough of a challenge for younger players to make this a good gateway game. The same humor, scripting, and play mechanics that feel childish to experienced players will be new and entertaining to those without experience.",70

3500,213,2766,8,"Succeeds as a simple, lighthearted platformer. It lacks the challenge and depth of other titles in the genre, namely Super Mario Sunshine and Sly 2: Band of Thieves, but offers nifty features like sprawling environments and a unique style to help offset its deficiencies.",70
3501,80,2766,8,"Shockingly decent. [Dec 2004, p.170]",70
3502,19,2766,8,It's geared toward younger gamers specifically because the level of difficulty and simplicity alleviates boredom.,70

Therefore, this Wii U version is more an addition than a real evolution.",70

3768,230,2871,15,"Wii Party U is far from a masterpiece, but you can be sure you'll have fun with it. It's not perfect, some games are boring, there is several problems with balance and with motion recognition, but it should help you to wait till the release of an all-new Mario Party.",65
3769,257,2871,15,It’s still not a patch on the better Mario Party games but its still one of the few video games where literally everyone can join in and have some sort of fun – from non-gamers to the ultra hardcore.,60

It features a wide selection of fun, albeit overly familiar mini-games, which are complemented by a decent number of unique and innovative multiplayer experiences.

3772,110,2871,15,"Wii Party U is meant to be played in a group of four, if only to have more people to talk to while you grind through an hour-plus board game session.

3777,160,2871,15,"In a world in which everything has to be faster, more fluent and easier, Wii Party U seems to adhere to blueprints from a long lost past. Its decent appearance and care that’s been put in the mini games, aren’t enough to keep this dance going. Instead of that, it generates awkward silences in between decent moments of fun. That’s extra painful for it being a party game and all.",50
3778,171,2871,15,"Wii Party U still fails to live up to the Mario Party series, and this game feels more like a demonstration of what you can do with a Wii U rather than an actual game.",50
3779,200,2871,15,Unfortunately the core game underneath the gloss and stacks of features is no better than the first Wii Party – and in many ways is actually worse. 80 minigames had better have a good strike-rate or they become a procession of annoying interludes; there are only so many ways you can throw a dice and move around a track.,40

3781,359,2871,15,"Meaningless microgames water down the package considerably. Instead of 80 plus games, many of which don't use the GamePad at all, Wii Party U would have been better served focused on what makes Nintendo's new home console unique. Of course, that kind of creative decision would have gone against what the real goal of Wii Party U is: to sell more Wii Remotes.",30

The combat mechanics are a solid combination of combo and tactical options, with a dash of insane supermoves for good measure.

On the positive side, BlazBlue features complex stories for each of its 12 fighters, magnificent art, special moves mapped to the right analog stick and lag free online play with detailed stat tracking. If you love anime, this is an essential purchase. On the negative side, however, BlazBlue's narratives make little sense, characters talk over one another before fights, others have long-winded dialogue and a steep learning curve will frustrate a lot of casual fighting fans hoping to button mash their way to victory; you just can't walk into this game expecting to unleash insane combos ala Marvel Vs.

3936,142,234,17,"It's at once entirely expected and a crying shame that this game won't catch on in the same way that, say, Street Fighter IV did, as BlazBlue packs what may be the best online play ever seen in a 2D fighting game (it is -- at worst -- neck-and-neck with the amazing Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix in this category, though the option to replay ranked matches certainly gives it a tantalizing edge).",90
3937,323,234,17,"Fire is the new dust, and BlazBlue is the new hotness of the fighting game world. Still a bit hard to fully grasp at first for newbies, but don't let that scare you off.",90

3943,86,234,17,Arc System Works has managed to create one of the best if not the best fighting game this generation.,90

3946,427,234,17,"The actual gameplay; in BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger; is relentlessly crazy, to the point where even two complete novices flailing away at one another will be entertained by the ridiculous crap they're able to pull off.",89
3947,372,234,17,"While its visuals are astounding and the fighting action nearly as impressive, Blazblue is special because it feels complete. Aside from its paltry online functionality, Calamity Trigger will constantly remind you that a smart investment was made in a title sporting a high degree of luster. In other words, you’ll get the sense that you got your money’s worth…even if you just got your butt kicked.",88
3948,147,234,17,"A great fighter, and definitely one that fans of Guilty Gear will want to check out.",85
3949,157,234,17,"Blazblue is easy to learn, but difficult to master, and contains a good overall game balance: which is all you need at it’s core. Ranked lobbies, however, need to be reworked.",85

3953,115,234,17,"While BlazBlue is unabashedly brutal online, there’s more than enough offline content to keep beginners busy until they feel skilled enough to brave online play. BlazBlue doesn’t apologize for its complexity, but it does make everyone feel welcome.",83

3956,289,234,17,"Every anime-riffic charcter - from Ragna, the slightly effeminate swordsman, to Taokaka, the obligatory catgirl - is beautifully drawn and totally bizarre. [Aug 2009, p.71]",80
3957,123,234,17,"The word hardcore works for and against the game. On the positive side, BlazBlue features complex stories for each of its 12 fighters, magnificent art, special moves mapped to the right analog stick and lag free online play with detailed stat tracking. If you love anime, this is an essential purchase. On the negative side, however, BlazBlue's narratives make little sense, characters talk over one another before fights, others have long-winded dialogue and a steep learning curve will frustrate a lot of casual fighting fans hoping to button mash their way to victory; you just can't walk into this game expecting to unleash insane combos ala Marvel Vs. Capcom 2.",80

3964,186,234,17,BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is an excellent fighter that deserves attention.,80
3965,413,234,17,"BlazBlue does, however, make a case for 2D sprites, much more so than King Of Fighters XII because the graphics are a lot smoother and they don't go all pixelated if you get too close to the screen.",80
3966,249,234,17,"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is not a game to fully understand, rather, just a game to play. It's got some weird themes, equally unusual characters but is vibrant and easy to get into.",80
3967,439,234,17,BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a hardcore 2D fighting game with a few concessions to open it up to beginners. The quirky sci-fi anime style and presentation is bang on the money and the graphics look fantastic in HD.,79

3970,353,234,17,"Overall, for all its bizarre dialogue, crazy stories and weird looking characters with strange voiceovers it works this game is amazingly entertaining and slightly addictive!",70
3971,19,234,7,"Visually appealing and off-kilter enough to remind even the worst cynics that games can actually have a fun core and work out from there — rather than building something then trying to figure out the fun part — BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger offers an interesting distraction, which might not be enough for hardcore fighting fans (who probably played the game to exhaustion years ago), but I'm not one of those people so I actually had some fun with the game.",75

3973,255,234,13,Shocking audiovisual section at service of one of the best games of the genre.,90
3974,448,234,13,"Truly a remarkable title that fans of the original will appreciate. If you like fighting games and have already experienced Arc's latest this version is certainly not going to deliver a brand new experience; in fact it may frustrate you due to technical limitations. However, if you love fighting games and don't mind playing them on a portable console with cramped controls you will be hard pressed to find a better experience out there.",85
3975,324,234,13,"A near-perfect port. [Issue#194, p.99]",84
3976,313,234,13,"A perfect compliment to the original. [July 2010, p.96]",83
3977,41,234,13,"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger Portable is a solid port that is on-par with its console predecessor. Although the visuals have been downsized and the online mode is missing, the new content added to the portable version more than makes up for these few shortcomings.",82

3979,213,234,13,"BlazBlue Portable is an impressive offering on its own, but gamers should keep in mind that the original PS3 version is superior, and the second BlazBlue title, Continuum Shift, has been confirmed for a U.S. launch.",80
3980,328,234,13,"BlazBlue Portable has made the transition from the PS3 to the PlayStation Portable exceedingly well, replicating every fun and addictive element from the console version and adding to it with new content. Visually, the game delivers, with a perfected art-design, along with the phenomenal sound effects. BlazBlue Portable delivers in every element imaginable, and can be enjoyed anywhere on the go.",80
3981,179,234,13,"A noble effort, but knock-'em-downs always lose punch when ported to PSP. [Aug 2010, p.104]",80
3982,451,234,13,"We struggle to see how this handheld version of Arc's brilliant new fighter could be much better without an arcade stick peripheral. Which would be stupid. [Aug 2010, p.123]",80
3983,262,234,13,"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger Portable stands as one of the best fighting game available for PSP, thanks to a solid gameplay and a good number of characters, each with abilities that make it more or less suitable for a particular approach. The ability to perform special moves by simply using the analog stick will annoy purists, but this feature can be useful if the movements required are too elaborate and difficult to achieve with the d-pad.",80
3984,148,234,13,"Undoubtedly generous, Blazblue Calamity Trigger Portable is gracefully ported to the PSP, with numerous modes of gameplay, its rich and deep combat system, excellent production values, and divine soundtrack. If you love the genre, it an excellent title for the PSP, despite its d-pad that can render the initial fights a little tricky, and the lower resolution of the sprites compared to the HD versions.",80
3985,1,234,13,"Despite the controls, BlazBlue Portable is a game that you'll probably find immediately appealing. It's easy to pick up and start firing off combos and flashy special moves, but for hardcore fighting game fans, only a handful of characters are viable on a competitive level.",67
3986,1,774,9,"You'll, fire thousands of rounds in hundreds of white-knuckled shootouts facing everything from soldiers to grotesques to specters, and tromp around in a totally bad-ass mech suit. Most importantly, you'll love every minute of it.",91
3987,413,774,9,"I can't recommend Monolith's sequel highly enough. It might not have the jaw-dropping visuals to rival Killzone 2, but it's a hugely satisfying shooter that'll have you clinging onto that controller or mouse throughout its tension-filled campaign. If you like your combat meaty and with a solid dose of supernatural scares, there's every chance this will rank as one of your favourite games of 2009.",90
3988,57,774,9,The F.E.A.R. series is top notch when it comes to digital horror. Very good sequel of a horror classic.,90
3989,124,774,9,"There have been very few original first person shooters in the last few years and if you were a fan of the original F.E.A.R., be prepared to fall in love once more. Graphically and audio wise the game impresses on many levels and if it was not for the average (below average) multiplayer experience this would be a perfect all around game for action junkies.",90
3990,395,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is as disturbing as it is satisfying. No, it's not perfect, but it certainly offers a lot of entertainment.",90
3991,197,774,9,"For action-fans, this game is a must-have. Concerning tenseness you will experience the same feeling as in Half Life. Simply take part in Alma’s return!",89
3992,320,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin has similar strenghts and weaknesses as the first game. While the action is great and the horror-elements work well enough, F.E.A.R. 2 suffers from rather un-inspirational enviroments. I love secret underground complexes as much as the next guy, but three of them in one game is a bit too much! [Feb 2009]",87
3993,324,774,9,"While not exactly original, Project Origin certainly offers FPS fans a vivid entertainment experience. If you’re a fan of the original and you’ve finished Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 then give this a look.",87
3994,426,774,9,A more than decent FPS/Horror game that will keep you entertained. Does’t provide as many scares as the original but makes up for it in presentation.,87
3995,268,774,9,"FEAR 2’s core is essentially a heart-stopping first person shooter, filled with memorable scenes and terrifying action. It makes shooting people fun again, unlike a lot of FPS titles where it feels like you’re killing mindless drones over and over. But the game also has mystery, suspense, horror and a brilliant storyline driving the whole experience that takes it to a new level.",87
3996,214,774,9,"We just wish Monolith had produced a slightly more progressive or challenging backdrop for the horror that is this game's mojo. It's absolutely worth playing, but that's the difference between a game that scores 9+ and a game that scores 8.6.",86
3997,223,774,9,"There’s certainly no arguing that Project Origin is an excellent, albeit, old-school shooter. It’s 2009 though and, from the game’s well-worn jolts right through to environments consistently drawn from the big book of FPS clichés – hello subway system, hospital, derelict street, science lab and underground bunker – there are simply too few moments that alleviate proceedings to the top tier of genre daddies.",85
3998,147,774,9,F.E.A.R. 2 is a great game that offers an intense single-player experience and a solid multiplayer experience. While the single-player mode might be somewhat linear and maybe a little too short the overall experience is still top notch.,85
3999,41,774,9,"As you can see, F.E.A.R. 2 is a very competent and enjoyable game. As a shooter, I was very impressed with the title. Unfortunately, I never really felt the fear that gave the game its moniker.",84
4000,448,774,9,"While it may not hold the same prestige of scaring the pants off of gamers like the original did, it remains a genuine thriller that will keep you immersed from beginning to end.",84
4001,110,774,9,"While the multiplayer is weak and the mood won’t make people forget Dead Space any time soon, the solid action core makes it worth a play.",83
4002,91,774,9,F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a defienate must for all shooter fans.,83
4003,213,774,9,"It’s a good shooter, bordering on great at times, but it’s not as groundbreaking as its predecessor. Still, it’s definitely faithful to the idea of F.E.A.R., which is mainly trying to get under your skin using a combination of tried-and-true horror elements, not the least of which is a creepy little girl.",81
4004,333,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2 emerges as an effective, entertaining FPS with a chiller story element, rather than a real survival horror shooter...Play with the lights dimmed, and don't be surprised if you end up squealing (on the inside) like a little girl. [Mar 2009, p.67]",80
4005,132,774,9,"Now, the spine tingling sequel, Project Origin is here to continue the story of the psychic and psychotic Alma with damn good results. [Mar 2009, p.78]",80
4006,99,774,9,"In short, if you like FEAR, you will love FEAR 2. It may be too scary for some and the wobble of your character walking might induce a slight bit of motion sickness, but it’s a well constructed horror/action title.",80
4007,123,774,9,"The presentation is top-notch, with tight level design and no shortage of jump-out-of-your seat moments. Multiplayer is somewhat empty, with only a few modes that all feel the same. There's no reason you should avoid F.E.A.R. 2.",80
4008,408,774,9,"FEAR 2: Project Origin leaves us quite an uneven sensation. On one hand it has offered us truly spectacular and full of tension moments, very different from the ones which other games in the genre offer. Moreover, its carefully made atmosphere, fueled by the solid graphics engine developed by Monolith, make the immersion sensation total. The problem is that although FEAR 2 knows what makes itself stand out from the other shooters, it insists on offering quite generic moments during most of the game, and, worse indeed, it's not quite polished.",80
4009,228,774,9,"While F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin will definitely appeal to fans of the first installment, newcomers to the franchise will also be pleased with the fast paced and action packed gameplay. Next to that, this game is a lot less scary than it's predecessor, making this a game well suitable for shooter fanatics. On the down low, it's a bit disappointing the multiplayer mode isn't all that.",80
4010,313,774,9,"More vibrant than the original but still falls short of greatness. [Mar 2009, p.64]",80
4011,178,774,9,"The main problems are more accurately missed opportunities, and much of the time playing the game will be spent wondering what could have been created if Monolith would have taken more creative risks instead of allowing themselves to craft a game too deeply within their comfort zone.",80

4013,62,774,9,Project Origin is really like every other first-person shooter out there -- but without multiplayer.,80
4014,86,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin presents no major additions to its predecessor and it’s not ahighlight to the brand. However, it is a great game for FPS fans and particularly for those who loved the first game.",80
4015,194,774,9,It’s a solid eight hour shooter experience that likely won’t hold your attention for too long after you beat it.,79
4016,4,774,9,"In order to define F.E.A.R. 2 we should use the word solid with all the good and bad things that it entails. On one hand are the obvious virtues that it inherits from the original, but at the same time this game lacks the spark and pace necessary to achieve its level. It does not give the impression that Monolith would have needed more time of development to improve the game but it seems that Project Origin, despite being a very good shooter, needs some extra points of inspiration.",78
4017,365,774,9,"Mixing a strong horror atmosphere and a solid “slo-mo” gameplay, F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin shines for the extension of the new levels. Its linearity isn’t necessarily a drawback (at least not for “old style” FPS fans), but it could still spoil the fun for next gen gamers, used to much more “open” games. Despite all of this, Monolith’s baby delivers a solid experience, and every FPS fan should at least give it a good try.",78
4018,316,774,9,"FEAR2 makes use of some really good gameplay mechanics, such as very satisfying shooting and terrific A.I. that help make the game fairly enjoyable. On the other hand, the deal breakers could be the excessive headbobbing, the average multiplayer experience, and dull visuals.",77
4019,50,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin dresses itself up like an edgy, scary, sinister horror of epic proportions. But under the surface it's a solid FPS with a good weapon set, clever physics, ample gore and Matrix-style slow-motion.",75
4020,329,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2 is a somewhat scary blend of action and horror, and although it relies too heavily on old ideas, it still offers an enjoyable experience.",75
4021,204,774,9,"Sure, there’s fun to be had shooting baddies in the face for 10-12 hours over the course of the 14 missions, but sadly F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin isn’t nearly as remarkable as the original.",75
4022,192,774,9,"F.E.A.R 2 is a great game to experience, but repetitive gameplay keeps it from achieving classic status.",75
4023,111,774,9,"It’s hard to play through Monolith’s F.E.A.R. 2 and not get a feeling of déjà vu. Between F.E.A.R., Condemned, and their sequels, this is the fourth scary, first person game that they’ve given us in a row, and unfortunately the experiences aren’t getting any fresher.",75
4024,140,774,9,"This somewhat scary sequel is a solid shooter, but it can't keep pace with its lauded predecessor.",70
4025,293,774,9,"Despite being a bit dated, F.E.A.R. 2 still delivers a solid shooter with enough scares for die-hard horror/shooter fans to relish.",70

4028,155,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2 is a middling shooter at best, and while the bare-bones mechanics are all tightly oiled, you’re left with a stale taste in your mouth. It may be the first big release of 2009, but it’s also the first big disappointment.",68
4029,393,774,9,"The fact remains that F.E.A.R evolved shooters back in 2005, but there appears to be very little progress in the four years since with F.E.A.R 2.",60
4030,64,774,9,"I honestly did not really mind that the game closed without fully explaining itself; the problem was that as the credits rolled my mind harked back to earlier points in the game, trying to give those supposedly standout moments a second thought, and realising none of them really stood out firmly in my mind.",60
4031,309,774,9,"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a stable first person shooter, but as it borders more on action than on fear this must be seen as some kind of failure on the games part. The long loading times detract from the enjoyment as well.",60
4032,115,774,9,"If you played the first few FEAR games and you want to know what happens next to the faceless, characterless, protagonist then you could do a lot worse than FEAR 2: Project Origin. I really can’t recommend this to players that are new to either the series or the genre. The lack of reiteration of the first game’s story is rather perplexing.",58
4033,136,774,9,"The game hardly lays out a convincing tale, which leaves gameplay to perform double duty.",50

4153,197,729,7,A lovely interactive story that enchants with funny dialogues and profound backgound.,89
4154,143,729,7,"It's not just a really good adventure game, it's got something to tell about the innocence of a child and the human trait to ignore inconvenient truths. It's more than just entertainment, it's art.",86
4155,192,729,7,"Witty, and with a wink and nod to the limitations of the point and click style adventure genre Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes gives gamers an adult experience while providing the necessary cover for a teen rating. Recommended for old school gamers looking for a reminder of the past, or those who enjoy quirky plots.",86
4156,298,729,7,"The sequel of Edna and Harvey: The Breakout again is a cool mix out of crazy puzzles and dialogues, black humor and a pretty good sense of humor and sarcasm. Harvey's New Eyes is even a bit better than the good Edna-adventure before. With Harvey's New Eyes Daedalic proves that they can increase the quality of their even very good games before due to the funny conversations, the bizarre characters and even their deaths.",85
4157,408,729,7,"A great journey through a dark story, where reality, madness and imagination is sometimes confusing. Some issues lower the quality of the experience, but it still is one of the best graphic adventure games we've played this year and every fan should try.",84
4158,148,729,7,"You don't need to have played the first Edna & Harvey :The Breakout to enjoy this sequel. It's a dark humor sweet wrapped in point & click paper, it's solid, and original.",80
4159,430,729,7,One of the most twisted and dark games you will ever encounter. It has everything from funny dialogues to the most innocent looking protagonist in a game ever.,80
4160,174,729,7,Just twisted and demented enough to be recommendable.,80
4161,89,729,7,"Harvey's New Eyes is a crazy adventure developed by Daedalic that introduces a new character in the mad world of Edna&Harvey. Humorous and Funny, it features pretty basic puzzles and situations.",77
4162,7,729,7,"Harvey's New Eyes is ridiculously easy to beat, but fun, not quite beautiful, but very stylish, never gets boring, but goes out with a whimper.",76
4163,302,729,7,"The first Edna & Harvey was weird, unique and original. The second attempted to be more weird, unique and original, but went too far and overdid it. Furthermore, one can’t ignore the complete lack of challenge and it’s a shame really, as there were some amazing ideas here…[December 2012]",74
4164,268,729,7,"For those who like their adventures on the darker, twisted - but still humorous side, Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes might just tickle your fancy. A worthy successor to the original.",72
4165,13,729,7,"Another entertaining game for those who can't get enough of the wacky blue plush rabbit, Harvey's New Eyes simplifies the Edna & Harvey experience but is slightly less fun to play as a result.",70
4166,427,729,7,"Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes isn't for everyone. The humor won't tickle everyone's funny bones, and the presentation of both the audio and graphical standpoints leaves something to be desired — despite some of the good things it does.",70
4167,250,729,7,"Despite serious gameplay and production issues, Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is still a memorable and enjoyable game.",65
4168,213,729,7,"Lilli's cute flavor of insanity makes her an intriguing character to play as, but she can't carry the plot of Harvey's New Eyes alone. The rest of the cast is so underdeveloped, the environments you explore so banal and uninteresting looking, that it's hard to appreciate Lilli's character or the smart puzzle design.",60
4169,64,729,7,"Edna and Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is an odd game with an even odder sense of humour. There's a definite Python-esque feel to its jokes, with some genuine laugh-out-loud moments that you won't see coming. Unfortunately, it's held back by some poor puzzle design that dragged out the story longer than it needs to. It's still worth playing, but these flaws really hold it back from being anything more than a one-time playthrough.",60
4170,67,729,7,"So much of what makes the game a repugnant mess in the opening soon makes sense by the end of chapter one, but many problems introduced at the start never fade away.",55
4171,233,2397,18,"The bottom line is that regardless of whether we're talking about character appearance, weapons, special abilities or buffs, Sunset Overdrive piles the number of options you can choose from sky-high. No matter who you choose to be, what weapons you equip, what playstyle you choose, or how you deck out your secondary abilities, everything feels valid and worthwhile.",100
4172,115,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive doesn’t take itself seriously, making the action and character of the game stand-out about as much as its vibrant color scheme. Sequences that slightly alter gameplay or offer up a big boss manage to delight beyond most of what’s available on the latest consoles today.",100
4173,73,2397,18,"This is the sort of game that people buy a new console for. It’s just that good. Sunset Overdrive celebrates the things that set us apart as gamers, and it draws strength from those differences. It never loses sight of the fact that fun trumps all in this sort of escapist fantasy.",100
4174,338,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is the most fun I've had in a game so far this year. A brilliant combination of all the best parts of other open world games, complimented with really enjoyable traversal mechanics and a unique sense of style and humor.",96
4175,151,2397,18,"There’s no question Sunset Overdrive lives up to the hype. It takes a while to adjust to the style of play it demands but once you do, you discover the pure joy that comes from playing a brilliant game. Flitting about the tippy-top of Sunset City, alternating between grinds and wall-runs to blow away hordes of hilarious enemies is a thrill you won’t soon forget.",95
4176,110,2397,18,"Outside of the mission monotony, Sunset Overdrive is an immensely rewarding experience that has a look and style all its own and a great gameplay package to complement it.",93
4177,125,2397,18,"Fact is, I had more unadulterated fun playing Sunset Overdrive than nearly any other game this year. You can tell that Insomniac had a blast making this game, and that joy transferred directly into me as I bounced on balloons in an amusement park, on to the rails of a rollercoaster, and then rained down explosive hairspray bombs to result in a brilliant orange explosion of goo.",92
4178,432,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is one of this year’s finest games, chock full with refreshing humour, a vibrant sandbox and some of the most fun gameplay mechanics we’ve experienced in some time. It’s a hit, so do yourself a favour and go out and pick up this son of a bitch.",92
4179,188,2397,18,"Outside of a sluggish opening hour, wherein you might struggle a bit getting used to the controls and traveling mechanics, this is one hell of a console exclusive. It’s bright, loud, and occasionally funny, but more importantly Sunset Overdrive is a ton of fun to play.",91
4180,213,2397,18,"Big, gorgeous, and a hell of a lot of fun. Never has getting from point A to point B in an open-world game provided so much enjoyment. It provides some of the most fun, frantic, and fantastic gaming I've had on the Xbox One.",90
4181,336,2397,18,"The best thing about Sunset Overdrive is how it's unabashedly enthusiastic about what it is, in just about every way. That enthusiasm, and the freedom behind it, is contagious.",90
4182,403,2397,18,"A welcome change of pace from the dour, serious AAA games we've been playing all year. Insomniac asks ""who do you want to be?"" with tons of customization options, some great weapons, and a very physical way to get around the city. The game feels a bit light in the content department, but it's undeniably fun.",90
4183,77,2397,18,"I went into Sunset Overdrive thinking that it’d be a fun, interesting smaller adventure in between the big blockbuster releases; now, it’s probably the most enjoyable game I’ve played so far this generation.",90
4184,37,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is a game that attacks so many senses, in a good way, that you may just find yourself not wanting to stop playing.",90
4185,4,2397,18,"With its action spectacle, Insomniac’s new game is ridiculously entertaining. Sunset Overdrive is just plain amazing, and hopefully it gives rise to a new franchise.",90
4186,70,2397,18,"The creative energy fueling Sunset Overdrive is an agent of change for a genre in creative decline. Its jubilant deluge of light and color, meaningful revisions to control and combat, and the sweeping diversity of skill-based missions push the open-world paradigm harder and faster than any of its peers.",90
4187,195,2397,18,"Whether you are defending a trash barge, grinding a dragon spine, or flinging bowling balls at exploding enemies, Sunset Overdrive is pure insanity – just how I like it. Come for the crazy, stay for the fourth-wall-breaking fun.",90
4188,83,2397,18,This is currently the best exclusive the Xbox One has to offer.,90
4189,170,2397,18,Insomniac Games is back with more madness and more insane weapons in a sandbox game that is sure to entertain.,90
4190,448,2397,18,"I can’t stress enough how much I love the look and feel of Sunset Overdrive. The style alone was worth the price of admission. Everything about it feels fresh. It isn’t derivative of other games, even though it borrows heavily from several.",90
4191,427,2397,18,"For action fans, Sunset Overdrive is a must-have title.",90
4192,111,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive’s blend of shooting, grinding, parkour, fetch quests, and tower defense makes for a complicated soup, but it still delivers a satisfying meal at the end of the day.",90
4193,10,2397,18,"Annoyances aside, this is the game for anyone itching for something that not only refuses to be taken seriously, it embraces its ridiculosity with open arms.",90
4194,268,2397,18,"I don’t think I’ve had this much fun with any other game so far this year, it’s been a true highlight. I can’t wait to jump back in and replay my favourite sections, compete for higher scores and have some fun in the Chaos Squad mode.",90
4195,344,2397,18,"If you own an Xbox One, this is a must-have game.",90
4196,74,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is just what the Xbox One needed - a distinctive exclusive to set the thing apart from the PlayStation 4. Titanfall was adequate and the Forza games are great for racing fans, but Sunset Overdrive is a glorious breath of fresh air.",90
4197,362,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is a great open world action adventure game that manages to impress through its rich environments, vibrant colors, and tongue-in-cheek attitude. While the missions are somewhat generic and the enemies are a bit cheap in their attacks, it's still an awesome investment for any Xbox One owner.",90
4198,63,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is the definition of the word “fun.” Insomniac has created something special here. The hilarious plot, unique gameplay, stunning art style and massive, explorable world translate to an unforgettable journey into Insomniac’s not-so-serious apocalypse.",90
4199,39,2397,18,Insomniac Games have just given a masterclass in taking a tried and tested game genre and making it feel fresh and fun.,90
4200,116,2397,18,"Mercilessly colorful futuristic city where virtually every element can be used for high-speed movement is likely to leave a newcomer more than a little confused. But once you become accustomed to it, mundane walking becomes almost physically painful: you’ll want to jump on the wires, bounce off the roof of some car, slide down the rails and never touch the sinful earth again. [Dec 2014, p.82]",90
4201,129,2397,18,Insomniac's brilliant sense of humour and superb gameplay design is present here as it was in the Ratchet & Clank series. Sunset Overdrive is probably the best Xbox One exclusive game for 2014.,90

4203,320,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive’s supercharged hyper parkour has a bit steep learning curve, but once you master it, this sandbox shooter shows its true colors. It's totally over the top, always on the move and absolutely hilarious. [Nov 2014]",88
4204,182,2397,18,"The look, feel, and sound won me over. Forgiving the mission structure and forgetting the tower-defense junk, this is pretty much what I would expect from an action shooter for this console generation.",85
4205,67,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive may have a few flaws inherent to many open-world games and lack an engaging narrative, but it's an incredibly fun, vibrant game that's a nice break from the overly gritty tone we see far too often in today's market. After Fuse, this is exactly what Insomniac Games needed.",85
4206,54,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive’s stylistic gameplay and juvenile attitude doesn’t make it a title for everyone. It is, however, an incredibly fun, visually beautiful open-world title that exhibits the best parts of what a sandbox game should be. Tight, stylish movement, engrossing combat and chaotic online fun makes Sunset Overdrive a no brainer for any Xbox One owner.",85
4207,260,2397,18,"A very different game from anything else Xbox One has to offer; colorful, hyper-frenzied, spectacular and packed full of hilarious pop culture references. With slightly less repetitive gameplay and maybe a higher challenge level, it would have been perfect.",85
4208,5,2397,18,"It is loud, it is silly and wonderfully weird. The mixture of skate action reminiscent of Jet Set Radio, the ludicrous weaponry Insomniac is known for and open world rail shooting delivers an arcade action overkill I haven’t seen in quite a while.",85
4209,228,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is creative and unique, especially in presentation and gameplay. It is too bad the mission structure is conventional, but we cannot be bothered as we have missed raging through a city Crackdown-style and Sunset Overdrive brings back that same grin on our faces.",83
4210,243,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is, without a doubt, a refreshing experience thanks to its fun mechanics and accessible gameplay. Breaking the fourth wall to address the player directly almost the whole time is its backbone and even when comparisons won't be in short supply, the incredible presentation, humor and addictive parkour will establish Sunset Overdrive as a must have game for every Xbox One owner.",83
4211,255,2397,18,Quotation forthcoming.,82

4213,174,2397,18,"That's pretty much all there is to Sunset Overdrive. You've got a skateboarding meets shooter game taking place in an irreverent Day-Glo punk rock world. And if that description appeals to you, you're going to love the game.",82
4214,262,2397,18,Sunset Overdrive is a fun and well crafted free roaming. Insomniac played it a bit too safe and their game isn't able to deliver on all of its excellent promises.,81
4215,220,2397,18,"Ironically, Sunset Overdrive resembles a lot the weird energy drink the game revolves around: refreshing, crazy-cool and full of bubbles (yet with a not fully convincing aftertaste). In the end, it's a solid and pleasing exclusive, but far from a killer application.",81
4216,82,2397,18,"Beneath the glorious tech, and once the writing relaxes a little, Sunset Overdrive's wonderfully lurid and heartfelt - a bit like playing an old 4AD album sleeve. If you get that reference, you'll probably get this, too.",80
4217,184,2397,18,You've never explored an open world quite like this. Sunset Overdrive's iffy gunplay and inconsistent missions are redeemed by absolutely amazing mobility and an infectious enthusiasm for mayhem.,80
4218,200,2397,18,"It’s a real breath of fresh air to travel around an open world with such wild abandon, and the variety of enemies combines with the general movement to make fun the most important aspect of the whole package.",80
4219,161,2397,18,"Sunset Overdrive is a great game, and with unrivaled freedom of movement, extremely fun dialogue and chaotic combat, it’s never boring. It might, on the other hand, be a bit too crazy, and the mix of traversal and shooting never quite matches up.",80
4220,140,2397,18,"Insomniac Games has crafted an excellent game in Sunset Overdrive. It's not without a few niggling issues, but you'll be too busy enjoying yourself to care. You can compare it to games like Crackdown, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and Ratchet and Clank, but by combining the best elements of those games into a single package and injecting it with an anything goes, rock and roll attitude, you'll never think of it as anything but a singular achievement that stands tall on its own merits.",80
4221,5,2397,7,It is loud. It is silly. It is wonderfully weird. The mixture of frantic action and skate acrobatics still delivers a very unique arcade action experience.,85

4224,421,2397,7,"Sunset Overdrive is one of the very few open-world games that sets itself apart from the competition with its unique and wacky setting, Parkour system and hectic gameplay experience, and all these are faithfully represented in the PC port. While solid, the port does lack some features that are expected out of a PC game in this day and age: this, coupled with the removal of co-op multiplayer, ends up damaging the experience. If you have no other mean of enjoying the game, however, Sunset Overdrive on PC is more than worthy of your time and money.",80

[May 2004, p.89]",90
4233,172,196,7,"Like its older brothers, BF Vietnam, though based on real battles and real places, doesn&#146;t focus so much on the gritty realism as on the &#147;excitement factor&#148; of war.",90

4240,141,196,7,"The single player aspect of the game is even more barebones then the previous title. Gone is the campaign and in is ""instant action"" which as you may have guessed allows you to select a map and then play with a number of bots.",86
4241,271,196,7,"I think it needs a little more oomph on more scenarios and the detail in the graphics. Also, conquering control points over and over gets too repetitive after long play.",85
4242,369,196,7,"The soundtrack, one of the best aspects of the game, effectively immerses you in the era, while the visuals make you really, really thankful you were not in Vietnam.",85
4243,117,196,7,"There's no doubt that Battlefield Vietnam is more like an expansion pack than a sequel, and it's not significantly different from the original nor is it a vast improvement on the Desert Combat mod. Fortunately, there are more vehicles and on a lot of maps the points are close together, making the action faster.",85
4244,450,196,7,"The new setting is wonderful for the type of game that Battlefield is, a freeform romp through the area with vehicles and different kits to wage war upon.",85
4245,142,196,7,"When it's all said and done Vietnam doesn't wow us the way that ""1942"" did in its day, but it's a step forward graphically, a leap ahead in the sound department, and just as much fun as the original.",85

4247,295,196,7,"An enormously rewarding and complicated game Battlefield Vietnam is then, and unquestionably an improvement upon its predecessor. At the same time, it&#146;s so remarkably similar to BF 1942 it&#146;s almost not worth buying if you&#146;re an existing fan.",84
4248,115,196,7,"The gameplay that was amazing a year and a half ago is not as shockingly new, leading to a battle that many of you will feel you&#146;ve already fought. Still, the seamless inclusion of land, sea and air combat coupled with the intensity of jungle warfare wins it a medal of honor.",83
4249,10,196,7,"What I personally would've liked to have seen from DICE is even more creativity in terms of map design, game modes and player classes.",83
4250,180,196,7,"Battlefield Vietnam loses out for just one reason, and that reason is that it never feels like a genuine sequel. The quantum leap isn't quantum; evolution has not created a new phenotype. It's simply not different enough or inventive enough. [PC Gamer UK]",82

4255,164,196,7,"Vietnam has all the great play elements 1942 had, and the addition of more varied aircraft such as attack choppers coupled with more technologically advanced weapons provide enough spice to make the games distinct.",80
4256,407,196,7,"The only truly outstanding aspect of the game is the scope and ambition of the game, which it pulls off just as competently as it's predecessor. It's close resemblance to the original works both for it and against it.",80
4257,136,196,7,"With the inclusion of a fully accessible level editing utility included with the game, as well as the capacity to accept third party modifications, Battlefield Vietnam is probably going to make as big an impact as ""Battlefield 1942"" did.",80

4263,253,196,7,What sets Battlefield apart is that you can pilot choppers and tanks to a cool &#146;60s soundtrack. And you can even cue up &#147;Ride of the Valkyries&#148; for that air cavalry attack. Sure smells like victory to us.,80

4266,99,196,7,"A Teen-rated, sanitized version of one of America's defining moments. And perhaps this substance is what's lacking, because while Battlefield Vietnam is a capable game, it doesn't have quite have the impact that its predecessor.",80
4267,446,196,7,"Although the game pays lip service to the famous -- and feared -- tunnels of the VC, there are no claustrophobic underground chambers and passageways. Perhaps engine limitations are the reason, but it's certainly a missed opportunity.",80

4412,6,2861,9,"WET is a action adventure you won’t find very often. The acrobatics are cool, but it’s something you need to do constantly. It breaks the pace of the game and aiming isn’t very fluent.

4654,232,1130,8,"There's only so much we can say to convey the atmosphere that ICO exudes, and to try and communicate the feelings that the game brings about when played but, the truth is, the reality of playing (now there’s a contradiction of sorts, but we’ll stick with it) is largely indescribable.",95
4655,213,1130,8,The feeling of simply being in the world that Ico creates is one of the most fascinating things I've ever seen in a videogame...The only unfortunate thing about Ico is that it's over just a bit quickly.,94
4656,8,1130,8,"It was a completely absorbing game that I just did not wish to stop playing. Even when I took the occasional break, my thoughts seemed to always drift back to this fantasy world.",93
4657,187,1130,8,"I swear your will I.Q. increase the longer you play it, as you are forced to really experiment and think things through just to get to the next stage. An awesome game with an awesome plot.",93
4658,320,1130,8,"An excellent action-adventure. The familiar theme of helping the girl through difficult places is still delightfully fresh. A true PS2 classic, no doubt about it. [Feb 2006]",93
4659,348,1130,8,"ICO has met and transcended most of my initial expectations: espousing staggering beauty with elegant control in a fantastical world of very human characters. I can only describe the game as a breathtaking voyage, filled with the wonder and majesty of a most regal dream.",92
4660,229,1130,8,The overall experience and intelligence of this game far outweighs the shortness. Every serious gamer owes it to themselves to at least play this game once.,91
4661,111,1130,8,"The grand environments create a fantastic stage for the adventure and the detail found in the textures, lighting and environmental effects are nothing short of superb.",91
4662,453,1130,8,Ico's simplicity is what makes it shine.,91
4663,41,1130,8,"Although it borrows from other gaming experiences in certain places, you haven't ever played a game like Ico. Highly recommended!",90
4664,50,1130,8,"The atmosphere of the castle is added to both by the superb sound and pacing of the game. The mellow speed of the game means that while there is the odd moment of button-hammering terror, most often you have time to sit back and rubberneck at the environments around you.",90
4665,394,1130,8,"The game is practically faultless and comes recommended to all, but it won’t last forever and is over too soon. Then again, the same could be said for sunset, but people don’t stop watching that because the onset of night is inevitable and quick.",90
4666,186,1130,8,"The visuals are stunning but not for full-blown 3D acceleration or the resolution, rather the epic and believable world that has been created for you to discover. It won’t take you long to complete ICO if you are semi-intelligent but you won’t feel cheated because it is very much a case of quality over quantity.",90
4667,120,1130,8,"For every 500 games that are boring, uninspired, graphically-enhanced rehashes, just one title like ICO is enough to reinvigorate my love of games and keep me going another day.",90
4668,168,1130,8,"A great game...And with beautiful graphical content and stunning sound effects, ICO is one heck of a production.",90
4669,317,1130,8,Ico isn’t a new type of game but rather one taken to near perfection. Rarely does a game gel like this and it’s simply the work of a master.,90
4670,110,1130,8,"In the end, I found this game compelling and highly entertaining, even though the puzzles are rather average and lack variety.",90
4671,393,1130,8,"Like “Memento” it has sleeper hit written all over it. Its a game for gamers that have played it all, and I recommend it to anyone who has every enjoyed an adventure game. Ico is like a fine work of art, so savor it.",90
4672,9,1130,8,"Visually, this game is stunning. It is one of the most atmospheric and engaging games I have ever played and the sounds fit the action perfectly with no annoying music to upset.",90
4673,105,1130,8,"An underappreciated work of art with challenging puzzles, fantastic lighting, and engrossing character relationships. [Feb 2003, p.92]",90
4674,287,1130,8,"Persevere to the bitersweet conclusion and Sony's uniquely atmospheric puzzle adventure will hold a place in your heart forever. [Feb 2006, p.88]",90
4675,184,1130,8,"Ico's flaws make it what it is, because without flaws there is no beauty, only blandness. Play Ico before you play 'sequel' Shadow Of The Colossus - it's the perfect companion piece.",90
4676,324,1130,8,"Untouched, beautiful and brings a tear to the eye. We would wax lyrical about this game all day, if we had the chance. [Apr 2006, p.112]",90
4677,80,1130,8,"With its sumptuous visuals, intuitive problem solving, and affectionately crafted storyline, Ico is like a favorite bedtime story that bears listening to over and over again. [Nov 2001, p.208]",87
4678,191,1130,8,"Though the shortness of a game may sound like a flaw, it’s really not. In ICO’s case, a longer length would have made the game quite tiresome as puzzle solving & pulling the girl from he pits of hell could tend to get a bit repetitive.",85
4679,180,1130,8,"If you are looking for something soft, slow and slightly soppy, there are few finer, moodier adventures around. [GamesMaster Magazine]",85
4680,147,1130,8,"An ""art-house"" game in a world of Hollywood-esqe world of action flicks. You get the distinct feeling this game was meant to be savored, not devoured; contemplated, not just consumed.",85
4681,140,1130,8,"The game is undoubtedly driven by its smartly crafted aesthetic mood, though its production never compromises the gameplay it provides.",85
4682,293,1130,8,"Ico is a fine game that boasts both excellent design and atmosphere, and one of the few titles from this generation that have and are likely to stand the test of time.",85
4683,263,1130,8,"Games like Ico are increasingly rare in their originality, honesty, and heartfelt approach to the digital form of entertainment.",84
4684,271,1130,8,"I didn’t find ICO to be that much fun, but that’s because I found it to be very short and not what I thought it might be. It is definitely entertaining and great to look at, but doesn’t have much in the way of replay value.",83
4685,374,2649,15,"True, it’s flawed, occasionally messy, and could do with being a little more accommodating to beginners. It also happens to be one of the boldest and most original visions on any system this year, and surely cements Hideki Kamiya’s place among the great game creators of his generation.",100
4686,55,2649,15,The Wonderful 101 is yet another hit by Hideki Kamiya and Platinum Games that's set to become a cult classic in the years to come and absolutely shouldn't be missed by anyone longing for something fresh and original. Simply wonderful.,100
4687,188,2649,15,"This is the very definition of a killer-app in regards to the Wii U library, and deserves every ounce of support the gaming community can muster up.",100
4688,220,2649,15,"Deep, rewarding, frantic and truly unique: The Wonderful 101 is nothing but an instant classic, something so pure and fun that represents the joy of playing videogames. You gotta be thankful to Platinum Games and Nintendo for this one, Kamiya surely did it again!",95
4689,243,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is an absolutely spectacular and memorable game that manages to represent the authentic spirit of arcade games, the original spark that gives life to great video games. This is not an easy game, nor does it facilitate the player's experience, but it reflects so much authenticity, life and pride for the trade that all minor imperfections are more or less forgiven.",94
4690,285,2649,15,"Played with patience and a willingness to learn, this isn't just the most surprising game on Wii U - it's the best.",93
4691,280,2649,15,People like me who will love the humor and get all the references will have an absolute blast.,91
4692,277,2649,15,There's simply no other game on the market with such a focus on ridiculous fun - this really is a must-have title for the Wii U.,90
4693,284,2649,15,"It might look childish, but in so many ways this is a Platinum Games experience through and through. Deep and rewarding combat, entertaining characters and plenty of hours of gameplay - even without all the collectables and tougher difficulties. A must-have for every gamer, whether you own a Wii U or not.",90
4694,86,2649,15,"It is in the design and concept of 100 superheroes that we find the starting point for a different experience that improves from GamePad with highly exclusive mechanics. Regardless of having been developed thinking on the touch screen or not, the experience remains focused on action sequences and great technical skill.",90
4695,83,2649,15,"The camera does its part in making some sequences a tad bit annoying, but that's just a small irritation in a game where everything else is so absolutely spot on. The whole game world feels like a gigantic box of toys come to life, bustling with charm and lovable characters.",90
4696,279,2649,15,"Quite frankly, there’s nothing else quite like The Wonderful 101 on the market. It’s an incredibly polished game that’s few blemishes are easily overlooked. If you own a Wii U, you owe it to yourself to see how wonderful The Wonderful 101 truly is.",90
4697,67,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is one of those rare games that keeps getting more and more fun the more that you play it. If you have the dexterity to handle the controls and the patience to deal with a few momentum-killing platforming/puzzle bits, you're in for a heck of a time.",90
4698,404,2649,15,This is the kind of experience which Nintendo promised when it announced the console - the kind of experience it deserves.,90
4699,145,2649,15,"While its action and playful aesthetic are easy to admire, perhaps The Wonderful 101’s best quality is evoking a child-like innocence.",88
4700,268,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 has its flaws, but thankfully they don’t surface very often, and let’s be honest, the presentation, graphical quality, humour, and insane gameplay make up for any shortcomings that may appear.",88
4701,408,2649,15,"If you like action games, you can't miss this one. Take your time, enjoy it. Being the Wonderful 101 is not easy, but it's very pleasant.",87
4702,262,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a clever, solid action game, but it has its flaws. Platinum Games delivers a fresh experience that revitalize the genre but on-screen disorder and a forgettable use of the WiiU Gamepad holds it from being even better.",85
4703,89,2649,15,The Wonderful 101 is one of those titles that you can't do anything but admire. A true jewel in the Nintendo Wii U lineup.,85
4704,5,2649,15,"It might not be the prettiest game, but once you get the idea of utilizing the weapon changing gestures, the Centinels will keep you in a firm grip with their positively hectic battles and challenging boss encounters.",85
4705,250,2649,15,What other game on the market today is like the Wonderful 101? None.,85
4706,4,2649,15,A very deep and fun new hack´n slash IP made by the same guys who delivered us Bayonetta.,84
4707,228,2649,15,"A sparkling game full of cute character, funny situations and spectacular boss battles. It’s a shame the bad recognition of symbols sometimes get in the way of the chaotic and fast gameplay. And the game sometimes gets frustrating when new enemies kill you before you even get a chance to find out their weaknesses. But despite it all, Platinum Games delivers a solid title that is interesting and beautiful in many ways.",83
4708,320,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a rollercoaster of emotions. When it's good, it's superb, but when it's bad, it's so frustrating you feel like throwing your gamepad into the wall. [Sept 2013]",82
4709,84,2649,15,"It can be confusing at first, but The Wonderful 101 has lots of potential to unleash. A great GamePad support, even if there's something more to do with this new controller, and graphics make it the best third-party exclusive for Wii U so far.",80
4710,140,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a bright, bold adventure that occasionally struggles to control its big ambitions.",80
4711,82,2649,15,"This is a love letter to childhood innocence, to that age where truth and justice and awesome costumes seem almost real, as well as the coolest things in the world. In that light, picking at it seems churlish, because The Wonderful 101 doesn't make you feel like a hero; it makes you feel like hundreds.",80
4712,200,2649,15,"It’s not always user-friendly, but it is incredibly unique and often very funny, which makes its difficulty all the more incongruous. The biggest problem is that it just doesn’t feel tight enough, and the input system is far too haphazard for precision. And yet, it’s hugely likeable and playable throughout.",80
4713,413,2649,15,"Hellishly addictive. The sense of fun is palpable throughout, the characters are mostly pretty likeable, and surprisingly the plot’s fairly absorbing. It helps that it’s been pretty sharply written too, full of excellently corny jokes and one liners.",80
4714,72,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a great fit for the Wii U, being rich in color and charm and putting the system's unique features to good use. Combat is strategic and rewarding, and some of the mechanics on show are refreshingly innovative.",80
4715,202,2649,15,"The game's tall difficulty belies its accessible aesthetic: make no mistake, this is a far more demanding proposition than its Pikmin cousin. And yet, these are the hallmarks that make Platinum's output some of the most exciting work in contemporary video games: scruffy invention in a playpen that allows for player mastery. In the midst of this riot of ideas and unrefined energy we can perceive some of the Wii U system's idiosyncratic wonder.",80
4716,160,2649,15,"Don’t be misled by the childish appearance of The Wonderful 101. This game fits perfectly in the series of (adult) games made by Platinum Games: extremely challenging, purely build on gameplay and unique. The game might not be as perfect as the other games that spawn from the Japanese studio, but The Wonderful 101 manages to pull it off thanks to its unique personality and gameplay.",80
4717,365,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101, in all likelihood, is going to become a cult classic. It's not perfect, it's not immediate and, above all, it's not the game that will turn Nintendo Wii U into a successful console. But at the same time, it's a game with many great ideas and way more than 101 wonderful moments.",80
4718,148,2649,15,"With such a powerful gameplay, a plentiful of heroes and a delightful drop of derision, it's hard to imagine a more wonderful successor to Viewtiful Joe.",80
4719,87,2649,15,"It's not a game for everyone, but if you liked previous games by Hideki Kamiya, like Bayonetta, you'll fall in love with this one.",80
4720,255,2649,15,Kamiya's first Wii U video game is a fast paced action game with its own style. Platinum Games tries to innovate in terms of gameplay and offers a colorfull and enjoyable experience with minor problems.,80
4721,430,2649,15,"When you are a true gameplay fetishist, The Wonderful 101 is simply a game you cannot skip. It manages to make you love gaming even more than you already do.",80
4722,377,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is an incredibly enjoyable game, despite the initially daunting control system. The nonsensical story, funny characters and intense action all come together to create an excellent romp. While the controls do hiccup on occasion and some later sections do drag on a little it still remains a uniquely enjoyable action title, and one of the strongest exclusives currently available for the Wii U.",80
4723,181,2649,15,"A truly hardcore, and original arcade fighting game that forgives not a slightest mistake, and it doesn't even bother with any tutorial. Still, the game's incredibly entertaining, and it will amaze you by a number of the game weapons' tactics and combinations, and its interesting control system. A pity the game's camera view doesn't work the way you would like to, but you'll manage.",80
4724,41,2649,15,"The campaign is meaty, plus there are co-op missions, score challenges, and plenty of collectables.",80
4725,233,2649,15,"Whatever issues might plague Wonderful 101 are glossed over with charm and an idiosyncratic vision. Sorting through dozens of heroes, picking out your leader and imbuing him or her with a personality feels like dumping your toy box on the floor and gathering up the ones you want to play with.",80
4726,403,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a great game tripped up by a drawing mechanic that may prove imprecise for some users. If Platinum's action games are your thing and you have a Wii U, it's a must-own.",80
4727,195,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is difficult to master, but the fact that it’s difficult to learn is what will hamper the progress of many would-be adventurers looking to join the battle against the GEATHJERK.",80
4728,192,2649,15,"It may not be the WiiU system seller Nintendo was hoping for, but for the hardcore, The Wonderful 101 is certainly everything they could want on the struggling system.",80
4729,427,2649,15,"The Wonderful 101 is a top-notch game from a top-notch developer. It isn't flawless, but the flaws don't detract from the whole.",80
4730,197,2649,15,"A motley action-firework, which partly does not shine, but still is a lot of fun.",80
4731,451,2649,15,"Here's hoping that when the Wii U picks up steam, The Wonderful 101 is still around. [Issue#139, p.94]",80
4732,240,2649,15,"Full of ideas, humor and difficulty, The Wonderful 101 will keep you glued to the screen, which can be both good & bad. But a little bit of challenge from a difficult game never killed anyone, right? [Issue#234]",80
4733,70,2649,15,"Part Bayonetta, part Viewtiful Joe, The Wonderful 101 is a game with a phenomenal, hilarious presentation and plenty of great ideas that is frequently hamstrung by its reliance on some unfortunate design choices.",78
4734,179,2649,15,"Stylish, fluid and charismatic brawler that's a little too wobbly and esoteric for its own good. [Nov 2013, p.72]",78
4735,159,1138,7,The addition of action elements to this adventure game really help keep it moving and exciting.,90
4736,300,1138,7,"A fun and imaginative game that, while not particularly engrossing or challenging, will entertain and amuse quite well.",83
4737,147,1138,7,"A solid adventure title that features great graphics, nice atmosphere and excellent sound. However, poorly implemented controls and a tricky camera mar the gameplay.",83
4738,10,1138,7,"The game doesn't innovate the genre in any way, but it does provide long hours of fun gameplay for those of us who are fans of action-adventure games.",82
4739,453,1138,7,"The music, puts the game right up over the top giving it an epic theatrical feel that makes it a fun play every time.",80
4740,19,1138,7,"It's stylish, fun and let's you go nuts with a whip.",80
4741,108,1138,7,Manages to capture the spirit of the films and packs a ton of combat and action sequences into a good old-fashioned adventure game. The puzzles are mindless so check your brain at the door.,80
4742,213,1138,7,"My biggest gripes against the game are the tricky camera and the horrible and frequent swimming bits. The interface is also somewhat clunky interface but, outside of these three issues, I had a lot of fun.",72
4743,140,1138,7,"While Emperor's Tomb has a few control issues that will take some time to get used to, the game's fast pace definitely makes for an interesting adventure.",72
4744,296,1138,7,"Though it's no classic tale, Emperor's Tomb has both actioning and adventuring in spades, whisking you off on a gorgeous cross-continental tour of exotic locales. [June 2003, p.68]",71
4745,49,1138,7,"Provides solid 3D platforming action with some panache - and the occasional little graphics glitch. [June 2003, p.94]",70
4746,142,1138,7,"Rather than approaching the controls from a PC-centric point of view, the developers seemed to be trying to graft the Xbox's analog stick control-pad system directly onto a mouse and keyboard setup.",68
4747,253,1138,7,"Despite the occasionally clunky controls, Emperor&#146;s Tomb does impress with its hand-to-hand brawls (Ms. Croft would be lost without HER weapons) and the free-range exploration allowed within each level.",60
4748,47,1138,7,"It gets the feel of the character right, and while the levels and controls can become annoying at times, most of the gameplay - particularly when fighting - is entertaining. [July 2003, p.82]",60
4749,78,1138,7,"Instant deaths, glitchy combat, uninspiring boss encounters and twitchy controls conspire to make this a below-par experience. If it wasn't for the occasional flashes of imagination and the familiarity and richness conveyed through the license then The Emperor's Tomb would be utterly forgettable. [May 2003, p.99]",40
4750,110,1138,8,"This title's epic scope, engrossing story, and addictive combat system easily outweigh these minor concerns. [Aug 2003, p.92]",83
4751,311,1138,8,"Solid gameplay, spot-on voice acting, and a classic Indy story make this a must have title. [Sept 2003, p.40]",80
4752,142,1138,8,"It's well worth your time to play through, if only for the motorcycle and gun turret scenes, and some of the more freakish weirdoes to cull later in your romp.",80
4753,213,1138,8,"I'd only get this if I were desperately in need of a new adventure game (any adventure game), or a ridiculous Indy fan. Or, if I'd never played an Indiana Jones game before, I'd get it but on another system.",80
4754,147,1138,8,"This may not be the prettiest game, but it plays great. It's a little mellow, yet still very addictive.",80
4755,180,1138,8,Its strongest asset is the fact that the developers have pulled off the feat of marrying some old-style Tomb Raider gameplay with a brilliant control system that makes Lara seem rather sloth-like by comparison. [Playstation 2 Max],75
4756,394,1138,8,"Get past the visuals, the levers, the stupid bloody water sections and you&#146;ve got a game that doesn&#146;t get anywhere near the high potential of the worlds greatest action hero, but still manages to provide some guilty pleasures.",75
4757,105,1138,8,"The textures aren't quite as sharp [as the Xbox version] and the framerate is a little dodgy, but Indy controls slightly better on the PS2 controller, thanks to the additional shoulder buttons. [Sept 2003, p.69]",70
4758,108,1138,8,A classic adventure that doesn't try to innovate yet still manages to deliver the goods.,70
4759,317,1138,8,Some people (myself included) just can&#146;t stand games with graphics as choppy and visually butchered as this one.,60
4760,132,1138,8,A mix of intense head-bashing against smart A.I. and an occasional crate-smashing balance out to some solid gameplay.,60
4761,288,1138,8,"The framerate here bogs down so much that it actually hampers gameplay. And there's no excuse for that - Emperor's Tomb isn't doing anything PS2 can't handle. [Aug 2003, p.98]",60
4762,159,1138,8,"Indy has a game that is worthy of his name in terms of gameplay and style, but definitely not technically on the Playstation 2.",60
4763,19,1138,8,The replayability is very poor as it is already boring the first time you go through it. Levels are very predictable and the action is weak... It's simply just not worth your time.,58
4764,323,1138,8,"Most disappointing, the drab use of color and flat architecture design show a basic lack of aesthetic awareness. [Aug 2003, p.77]",50

4767,195,1138,16,"This is high adventure in the grandest sense, and running around in the shoes of Indiana Jones is truly a great thing. Not to mention the manual has got to be seen to be believed. It&#146;s so bloody cool, it&#146;s amazing.",96

4769,180,1138,16,"It's all top notch Indy stuff and perfectly captures all the ace elements of the man and the movies. Monsters, exotic locations, suspicious characters and back-stabbing. He even looks and sounds like Harrison Ford which makes it all even more believable, charming and utterly essential. [GamesMaster]",92

4773,10,1138,16,If there is a problem with the game it's that it offers nothing new to this style of game that hasn't already come from the Boob Raider saga. That's not to say it's a bad game. It a great game.,85
4774,372,1138,16,"LucasArts did a fine job making the closest thing to a replication of all the movies thrown into a video game. The gameplay is fantastic, the level design is overwhelming at times, and the graphics and sound make their own positive arguments.",84
4775,128,1138,16,"It's like ""Tomb Raider"" with a better fighting engine. [Apr 2003, p.54]",83

5413,262,2484,14,"Even if it’s not nearly as bad as most of the recent Tenchu games, Stealth Assassins sadly fails in delivering a concrete upgrade to the series: developer Acquire wanted a game that both hardcore and casual gamers could get into, but the risk is that nobody will really like it.",69
5414,195,2484,14,"The graphics are average for the Wii, the sound is out of place, the sword fighting is Red Steel levels of bad and the fact that the bad guys will let their guard down when their buddies are lying dead at their feet all add up to a disappointing game. Hopefully Ubisoft goes back to the drawing board before releasing Tenchu 5.",69
5415,1,2484,14,"Once you grow accustomed to the game's quirks, you soon find yourself in a rhythm where gamer instincts overcome sloppy game mechanics. Eventually, the thrill of starting a level -- unarmed -- and slowly but surely making your way over rooftops and underwater and over rafters becomes a guilty thrill.",67
5416,110,2484,14,"However, the clunky controls, frustrating camera, and broken combat all spoil the game's flow. [Apr 2009, p.86]",65

5418,78,2484,14,"The simple Remote application – flicks to activate instant takedowns – is one of many wise steps taken away from the convoluted mechanics weighing down other current-gen entries. [Mar 2009, p.93]",60
5419,160,2484,14,"The new and improved puzzle-styled Tenchu: Shadow Assassins is a step in the right direction for the series. Nevertheless the game has little to do with the original Tenchu, making it a strange experience for the Tenchu veteran. But if you're open to it, Tenchu: Shadow Assassins will offer a very entertaining fifteen hours of ninja-power.",60
5420,257,2484,14,"The best Tenchu for years, even if it does still leave too many frustrating relics from the past.",60
5421,413,2484,14,"There are two campaigns to play through, an extra series of 50 brief assignments to complete, and a smattering of new items and artworks to unlock; to this extent, the game is quite generous, but I think that most players would have preferred less content and more room to manoeuvre.",60
5422,240,2484,14,It could be a great stealth action game but inaccurate controls and offenses against stealth genre corrupt all the fun. [May 2009],60
5423,136,2484,14,"Tenchu works best when taken as a puzzle game that requires you to master your ninja sense and proceed step-by-step, error-by-error, to every stage’s inevitable boss. As a “stealth action” game, however, it falls short of expectations.",58
5424,140,2484,14,"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins attempts to sneak in the footsteps of its stealthy predecessors but ends up a stumbling, bungling mess.",50
5425,99,2484,14,"The series makes a blind leap into a new genre, only to fall flat on his face satisfying neither the fans of puzzle or action games.",40
5426,408,2484,13,"The new Tenchu installment will surprise positively series followers, apart from genre fans. It is a slow game in which we'll have to think twice each of our steps in order to survive. It has great hours of action and fun, and also offers a story worth being followed up to the end.",85
5427,188,2484,13,"I guess you could argue that the game loses a bit of its charm with the lack of the motion specific controls, and I'll agree to a point that they did add a little bit to certain movements, and they definitely made the kills feel a bit more visceral. However, the PSP version is definitely my preferred way to play the game, it didn't frustrate me control wise nearly as much as the Wii version did, and from that aspect alone I enjoyed it more.",83
5428,132,2484,13,"A die-hard Tenchu fan, Heather was more than happy to see the series return to form in its latest portable iteration. It may even move a hardened assassin to poetry.",80
5429,184,2484,13,Shadow Assassin's flaws are easily forgiven though because the end package is just too great to hold a grudge.,80
5430,147,2484,13,"Shadow Assassins for the PSP is not only a good entry in the Tenchu series but it also does stealthy ninja action well enough on Sony’s handheld. While the hardware limitations make for some slightly awkward gameplay issues, it doesn’t take away from an overall fulfilling experience.",75
5431,4,2484,13,"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins redefines the series in a videogame more reflexive and less action paced than its predecessors. It's difficult, it's engaging and it's immersion, but the Wii version is better.",73
5432,324,2484,13,"All credit to FromSoftware for cramming Acquire’s Wii version onto the PSP, but the slowdown can be a real drag in intense situations, and sometimes the conversion just feels a little sloppy.",71
5433,255,2484,13,"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins is back on the verge with an adaptation that has nothing to envy its his eldest brother. It's very much the same game that we saw with the Wii version, with a funny story mode and a fair gameplay system that offers lots of stealth and a little bit of action. If you liked the original one, take your chances, but bear in mind that there isn't anything new to be considered if you owned the Wii edition.",70
5434,214,2484,13,"Tenchu is a fun PSP effort so long as you think of it as an all-new take on the franchise. The levels you play through are self- contained puzzles and not wide-open ninja-filled action-fests. If you prefer stealth to pure swordplay, you'll surely appreciate this approach.",70
5435,314,2484,13,"It's limited, but what's here is well-executed and very playable, even on PSP. [May 2009, p.84]",70
5436,365,2484,13,"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins may not be suited for long time fans, who will find a different gameplay, more puzzle oriented. The game is fun, anyway, even if it lacks the action typical of the franchise.",65
5437,332,2484,13,"It's painstaking but satisfying. [June 2009, p.103]",60
5438,57,2484,13,The inflexible camera and the annoying trial&error gameplay will freak you out after a while.,60

5440,262,2484,13,"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins delivers lots of stealth action, but it gives you absolutely no choice on how you beat each mission: if someone sees you, it's over. You can't go on rooftops anymore, and the first person combat system is poor and frustrating. The game comes with some good graphics, but the gameplay suffers from several flaws.",59
5441,313,2484,13,"An occasionally satisfying, but often frustrating experience. [June 2009, p.76]",57
5442,333,2484,13,"Ninjas are supposed to be cool. But when a poor control scheme and an even worse camera system make it difficult to perform even one of the three activities mentioned above, they're anything but. [June 2009, p.83]",50
5443,259,2484,13,"Shadow Assassins could've been a great game had some things been changed or revamped. Instead, only the truly dedicated will see it through to the end, and even they may opt for the original PSOne game instead.",40

5455,142,2233,3,"Everything that a side-scrolling platform loving fan could ask for. It's got all the great, tried and true, fast-paced Sonic action of the old Genesis series, looks fine, plays excellently, and offers some fun multiplayer action.",88

5460,99,2233,3,"Simply experiencing the old-school ""Sonic"" gameplay again after so many years of 3D titles makes the title a must-have for longtime ""Sonic"" fans.",80

5470,142,1039,16,There is no reason to jump onboard its potentially dynamic ride unless you have the time to virtually marry the game...it will also be well worth the effort.,86
5471,254,1039,16,"Those with the patience and time however, will find a rewarding gaming experience.",83
5472,444,1039,16,I predict that diehards will cherish this game for ages. Unfortunately novice players will get frustrated after the love affair with the graphics ends and the real challenges begin.,83

5474,289,1039,16,"It's hard as hell, partially because it's meant to be, partially because the complex, non-adjustable control scheme is completely non-intuitive, and partially because the camera is simply too twitchy...[yet] we love the strangely gorgeous Gunvalkrie. [Apr 2002, p.72]",82
5475,453,1039,16,"If it weren't for the controls, this would have been a perfect game to add to your gaming collection or Sega collection, but I figure Sega spent too much time on graphics and not enough time realizing that ""Hey, these controls are worse than Tomb Raider!""",81

5477,253,1039,16,"Thankfully, the ability to upgrade your jet pack adds a much-needed modicum of depth, while the control scheme makes it easy to move in one direction while blowing stuff up in the opposite. Titanium-breasted robozons, a-w-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y!",80
5478,99,1039,16,"Its original plot and setting, polished visuals, and overall high production value make this a must-have for any skilled console gamer. It's unfortunate that its seemingly complex control scheme will alienate most casual players.",80
5479,446,1039,16,"If you're impatient, have bad carpal tunnel syndrome, or just never got that whole hand-eye coordination thing down, this probably isn't the game for you.",80

5482,394,1039,16,"If you can adjust to the tricky controls and the shockingly hard difficulty setting, then you'll find a fun, original title that mixes current 3D game design with the style and atmosphere of a retro classic.",70
5483,187,1039,16,"I've never seen a shooter that I could really consider a linear game before, but rather than let you destroy monsters your way, GUNVALKYRIE has too many movement puzzles that can only be solved one way that the designers anticipated.",69

5485,140,1039,16,"While it all could have worked out nicely and been a solid action game, the game's touchy and occasionally awkward control pushes the game past the ""nice, firm challenge"" stage and up into the ""frustrating trial-and-error"" difficulty level.",62

5488,79,1039,16,It's just too unnecessarily frustrating. Gunvalkyrie simply should have had a little more polishing.,60
5489,130,1039,16,"The most baffling part of the game's design [is] the horribly inept control scheme. Instead of fully taking advantage of the Xbox controller's functions, everything is crammed and clumped together.",60
5490,14,1039,16,"Gets high marks for its animé style, engaging boss encounters, and interesting control system. But similar games like ""Jet Force Gemini"" or ""Body Harvest"" offered more in the way of story and role-playing elements to help break up the monotony of blasting bugs and jumping platforms.",60

5495,366,2045,10,"It's a blast to play and it only gets better as skills improve over time and as the competition ramps up. It's a game that everyone, whether they’re big into sports video games or just can’t seem to get into them, will really enjoy.",100

5550,344,2045,18,"Relatively very minor gripes aside, Rocket League is a genuinely new type of game that provides addictive, enjoyable, skill-based fun that doesn't prevent new players from joining the fray and which never threatens to become dull.

This is absolutely superb and will keep you entertained for many, many hours.",90
5551,403,2045,18,"Rocket League is simple in concept - it's basically soccer with cars - yet it works brilliantly as a multiplayer game. It's incredibly easy to pick up as a beginner, but learning the intricacies of its controls takes many, many hours. And doing so is a thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding experience.",90
5552,262,2045,18,"Rocket League brings to Xbox One the same amount of fun that we enjoyed on PC and PlayStation 4. It doesn't have the cross-play functionality with the two original platforms, but has greater value as you can also get all the 3 DLC packs for the same price.",90

5567,202,2045,7,"What has made this game special is the extra layer of polish on an idea that was already refined, and the resistance to adding unnecessary extras: in this way, it feels like a Nintendo game.

5571,70,2045,7,"Most sports would probably be better if human participants were replaced with cars. While this thesis is typically reserved for late night conversations with close friends, Psyonix accepted it as a genuine assignment and produced Rocket League.

5576,352,2045,7,"It's football with cars wrapped up as a well-designed, thrilling and addictive game. With its precise controls, it's easy to learn but hard to master. Everyone will have a lot of fun but the multiplayer, preferably with friends, is where it truly shines.",85
5577,256,2045,7,"Rocket League has interesting gameplay. Is that football? No! Is that car race? No! Rocket League is a different type. Addictive, easy learn and extremely fun. If you like arcade games, don’t miss it.",84

5582,34,2045,7,"Do you remember “Top Gear” episodes in which football matches were played using hatchbacks? The same idea is the cornerstone of Rocket League – one of those jewels that do not care for bells and whistles (though it does look great) and Kevin Spacey in the credits, instead focusing on squeezing every last drop of fun out of a simple concept.

5588,188,2045,6,"Overall, there’s a lot of fun packed into Rocket League, and this port to the Nintendo Switch manages to keep all of that intact. If you’ve never played, you absolutely should, and the Switch version of the game makes for a solid addition to Nintendo’s ever growing library.",100
5589,213,2045,6,While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go – which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode – the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent and all platforms.,93

5593,277,2045,6,"Don't let anyone tell you that Rocket League is simplistic or lacks longevity; the vibrant community that has grown up around Psyonix's masterpiece renders that viewpoint wholly incorrect. This is a game tha t rewards skilful play and perseverance, and new tactics and strategies seem to flow from each and every match you partake in. Only the occasional network niggle throws shade on this otherwise sublime release; the Switch has yet another must-have release to add to its awe-inspiring 2017 pile.",90
5594,77,2045,6,"The formula that has kept Rocket League fresh translates exceedingly well to Nintendo’s hybrid system, whether docked or portable. Less polished visuals are a small price to pay to be able to play Rocket League anytime, anywhere, at a performance level that never quits, though the notable jaggies and (through no fault of its own) a hindered party system mean that the Switch version isn’t the most competitive version of the game.",90
5595,417,2045,6,"Rocket League is an indie success story, and to have it in the Switch's library year-one is terrific. Look at all the jaggies you like and mock the lower resolution the game runs at if you feel the need, but this is Rocket League, portable and it runs beautifully. Everything is here, nothing has been missed and there are bonuses for Switch owners not only with exclusive Mario cars and hats but also the ability to take it anywhere. A feature that cannot be overlooked. Rocket League is a really deep game. Following the clichéd easy to learn, hard to master approach holds Rocket League in good stead. You're going to want to put in the hours to be the best you can - but the only thing that's really going to stop you is sleep. You're not going to put this one down.",90

Rocket League for Nintendo Switch is the most complete version of this game.",90
5598,279,2045,6,"Rocket League is one of my favorite releases of the last few years. Having a portable version that lets me easily jump online at any Wi-Fi hotspot is amazing to me. I’ve been playing quick matches while waiting for the NYC subway and during my lunch break at work. The one major negative is the resolution in undocked mode. I personally haven’t felt like it’s hindered a match for me, but it’s still pretty annoying. Nonetheless, there’s endless amounts of fun to be had with Rocket League and even with some graphical shortcomings it’s still a must buy on the Switch.",90

5600,370,2045,6,"It's Rocket League, and it's incredibly entertaining. Static screens do not do this game justice; yes it's a little rough visually but you will hardly notice because you will be having so much fun. It's brilliant. If you love fun, football and/or racing you'll love this.",90
5601,410,2045,6,"Rocket League on the Nintendo Switch is simply Rocket League. And why should it change? The graphics are a bit worse than it’s bigger console brethren but other than that this version offers so much more: New Cars and Hats, additional options to play with friend and the ability to go fully portable with a game about freedom of movement. This port can be summed up by two words: “No Problem.”",90

5605,262,2045,6,"Panic Button's port of Rocket League is far from perfect, but graphics have always been a secondary matter for Psyonix's phenomenal game, and this holds true for the Switch version. Fun, fast and exhilarating, it's still a must have for anyone who loves to play online.",86

5608,4,2045,6,"Rocket League feels great in portable mode. Cross-network with Xbox Live and PC, Psyonix and Panic Button has managed to maintain a good on-line stability. Poor visuals in tablet mode, but it’s 60fps, essential for a fluid and solid Rocket League experience.",85

5610,115,2045,6,"Rocket League is a fast, frenetic and addictive game, and playing it while on the move ensures that you won't feel compelled to put it down until your Switch's battery runs out. While this isn't the best-looking port, its smooth and stable performance makes up for it, and being able to play it on the move is a great twist on a winning formula.",80

5615,55,2045,6,"Rocket League is showing no signs of slowing down, and why should it? Psyonix's RC car-footie combo is an esports favourite, and now even more players can see what the fuss is all about on Nintendo Switch. A visual downgrade is acceptable given that this plays exactly the same as the other versions, with cross-play to ensure the pool of opponents remains large online. A strong recommendation for any Switch owner - even for those who have it on another platform! After all, what Rocket League fan wouldn't want to train and match up on the go?",80

5619,35,2045,6,"In the end, this is not my favourite version of Rocket League, but it is one that you can enjoy. The gameplay is identical to the other versions in most ways, but the graphics of the Switch version are ugly. The resolution is so low.",70
5621,117,885,8,"The lack of depth in the game’s structure and driving system would deter most hardcore gamers from trying it, while the Mustang fans would be driven away by the over-competitive AI before you can start a Mustang’s engine and warm it up.",90
5622,3,885,8,It’s stylish enough with its heavy metal soundtrack and graphics to hold its head up against those ultra fussy techno-tappit-head driving games (the ones that make you choose what type of screws hold the suspension together before you are allowed to leave the pits) but it’s easy enough to be fun and challenging at the same time.,80

5639,147,2984,8,"The amount of strategy required to play this game is impressive, if not intimidating. It will take some time to understand the mechanics of the game, but once you do, you&#8217;ll likely find the gameplay strangely addictive.",79
5640,450,2984,8,"The game at the core of Capsule Monster Coliseum actually borders on engaging, and as such comes incredibly close to being worth playing for those who aren&#8217;t fans of the series. But close, as they say, only counts for horseshoes and hand grenades: not PS2 games.",70

5792,123,1448,7,"There are still some strange artificial intelligence quirks in both the turn-based and real-time aspects of the game, and it appears that the Total War franchise is starting to steer away from more casual players who would prefer a little less realism in their game.

6021,64,1151,9,"Inversion might not be innovating in its field with the Gravlink mechanic, but get past the start of the game and you'll open up to a rather enjoyable and good enough shooter that fans of the genre should give a chance before writing it off as a poor man's Gears of War.",70
6022,19,1151,9,"The campaign is a solid adventure that is best enjoyed with another person (rather than the AI!) and the game offers a certain level of ""surprise"" with some of its unique gameplay elements. It's just a shame that some of these unique elements are not incorporated better or injected more frequently in the campaign.

6025,427,1151,9,"Inversion isn't bad, but it isn't good, either. It's a generic, dull third-person shooter that is competent enough. Aside from some issues with aiming the Gravlink, everything works about as well as it should, but that's the kindest thing one can say about the title. Forgettable enemies, bland locations, boring gunplay and a clichéd story combine into a product that has little entertainment value.",60
6026,72,1151,9,"Overall, Inversion is a game that feels instantly familiar, and not in a good way. The game lifts heavily from more illustrious sources, while its own unique selling point, gravity powers, never feels fully exploited. But equally, the game is a solid and reasonably well-produced shooter that is fun to play, particularly with other people. As long as you don't expect a revolution, you will have a good time battling this particular alien invasion.",60

6031,328,1151,9,"Unfortunately, everything that could be used to make Inversion a unique and standout game - if not a sleeper hit - has such a small presence in the game that it just feels like a squad shooter with decent mechanics and some different ideas.",55
6032,111,1151,9,"Inversion is not a good game. It's an unpolished game with a single good idea, the Gravilink, and that's really not enough to carry the entire experience. The multiplayer alone makes Inversion worth a rental, but I suggest skipping the intensely boring campaign.",50
6033,313,1151,9,"It's a decent enough shooter, but the lack of ideas and fiddly controls - especially through zero-gravity sections - make this a dead cert for the bargain bin. [Aug 2012, p.102]",50
6034,329,1151,9,"In the end, you will likely finish the game in about 7-9 hours, but still feel like you didn't play it. It is that forgettable.",50
6035,324,1151,9,"Inversion flirts with the idea of having ideas, but then gives up all pretence of inventiveness and settles for being a bland and forgettable third-person shooter. [Issue#220, p.80]",49
6036,326,1151,9,"Inversion has a great premisse, an interesting story and an overall solid control scheme. This, however, isn't enough to save the game from mediocrity. Its biggest crime isn't the short campaign or the graphical flaws, but the fact that fooling around with gravity - supposedly the game's big hook - isn't at all necessary.",45
6037,188,1151,9,"Overall I don't think it's a game that's really worth your time, unless you've literally nothing better to play within this particular genre. Worth a rental, maybe, but certainly not a purchase.",42

6040,161,1151,9,"Inversion is the epitome of uninspired game design, as even it's core elements never manage to be anything but mediocre. On top of that it does nothing to set itself apart from every other third person shooter on the market, and even the slightly entertaining gravity-powers doesn't do it much good.",40
6041,52,1151,17,"In summary, Inversion is a pretty good shooter that is worth being looked at by any fan of the genre. It is an enjoyable playthrough but not something that screams for a repeat performance.",75
6042,320,1151,17,"A decent cover shooter which gets better towards the end. The gravity effects are nice, but they could be much nicer, if you could control the direction of gravity, not just the amount of it. [Aug 2012]",75

6044,225,1151,17,"In the end, Inversion has some great concepts but suffers from its rather linear design, especially in relation to the gravity powers your character has access too.",72
6045,268,1151,17,"Inversion is at its best when played cooperatively, and the gravity mechanics are built around that fact.",68
6046,408,1151,17,"We have liked Inversion much more than we expected, as it is an enjoyable product with some good moments and ideas and spectacular modest, despite being quite a modest production. It could have been much better, of course, and it has room of improvement in almost every area, but it entertains and the idea of gravity manipulation is good, although it could have been made the most if only the developers had been more ambitious.",68
6047,260,1151,17,"Inversion feels like a missed chance: Saber nailed the gameplay basics following Gears of War's footsteps, but the gravity-based mechanics needed a more creative and emergent approach. An interesting plot would have helped too.",65
6048,262,1151,17,"An average third person shooter, with some nice ideas which never reach their truly potential. Ugly story and characters.",65
6049,228,1151,17,"Everything in this game has been done before, and has been done better. Not having split screen co-op is unforgivable; Inversion seems to be made for playing it with another player next to you. A lot of variation makes the single player experience somewhat decent, but never rises above mediocrity.",65
6050,19,1151,17,"As a third-person shooter, Inversion has some fun and long-lasting single-player gunplay (even if it does a huge amount of copycatting off of Gears of War). That's despite an utterly incomprehensible and confusing single-player story filled with too many plot holes along with a very sparse online presence to date.",65
6051,110,1151,17,It's a completely mediocre shooter that's actually weighed down by its distinguishing gimmick.,60
6052,289,1151,17,"Your journey quickly settles into an endless slog of interchangeable shootouts, broken up by little more than hold-the-door-for-me-bro tedium and boss battles that range from serviceable arena showdowns to infuriating cover-free patience-drainers.",60
6053,41,1151,17,"What we're left with is two-thirds of a campaign that competently rips off Gears of War, and some multiplayer modes that aren't bad. That's not enough to justify a rental, much less a $60 purchase.",60

6058,78,1151,17,"There's an overall level of polish to Inversion that shows a developer improving its skillset. Though the game never fully stretches its ambitious premise beyond the confines of the cover shooter genre, it's a game with the noblest of intentions: to provide wall-to-wall, or, rather, floor-to-ceiling, entertainment.",60
6059,451,1151,17,"If only the gameplay was as well realised as the engine that runs it, Inversion would be far more recommendable. Regrettably, as it stands, Saber Interactive has created a mechanically robust game, but one that doesn't do enough with the ideas it can lay claim to as its own.",60
6060,160,1151,17,"That Inversion has been released without publisher Namco Bandai even making a sound about it, says it all. Inversion doesn't do anything particularly well and mostly just copies other games. But the shooting is descent enough and keeps you busy for about six hours at a high pace. It's mediocrity in its purest form.",60

If you liked Gears of War, you'll enjoy playing it, but you might find its sheer familiarity a bit annoying. And if you like third-person shooters that don't require superhuman skills, you'll enjoy it, too. But if you're looking for something futuristic, cutting-edge and distinctive, keep on looking.",60

However it is a solid game, with satisfactory gameplay mechanics, some consistently implemented fresh ideas and interesting storyline which ends with a cliffhanger that will remain unresolved. Worshipers of the Gears of War religion, give Inversion a chance.",60
6066,145,1151,17,"It is yet another game with potentially interesting mechanics that fail to deliver on their promise, making Inversion's approach to gravity feel more plodding than liberating.",58
6067,5,1151,17,"The action takes its inspiration clearly from games like Gears of War, mixes it with a little Rage and adds Army of Two as garnish. The problem: It rarely achieves the quality of the originals. Vector and gravity changes are interesting elements, but are just tapping their potential.",56

6081,140,1151,17,"Inversion isn't clever in the slightest. It's about as trite as a shooter can get, and its attempts to jazz things up with gravity-based antics come across as a jumbled mess, rather than as the clever invention it so badly wants them to be. Inversion is a third-rate knockoff full of cheap thrills, subpar acting, and a hefty dose of cheese--fun for a B-movie-style evening of masochistic punishment, but like most guilty pleasures, it's probably best to keep this one to yourself.",40
6082,233,1151,17,Inversion is so generic that I'd sooner recommend just about any other of gaming's numerous cover-based shooters ahead of it – especially since its anti-gravity mechanic barely even factors into the grand scheme of things.,40

6089,146,1151,17,"It's never satisfying to condemn any game but it's hard not to with Inversion. There are glimmers of nice ideas within, but the water is too muddied to see them clearly. All that's left is a bunch of mechanics that we've all seen before, and better implemented elsewhere.",30
6090,63,1151,17,"Regrettably, it amounts to a barely-competent shooter with an off-putting aesthetic, ludicrous plot, gimmicky hook, and a frustrating tendency to repeat its boss-battles more than a JRPG.",30
6091,197,1151,7,"Inversion has lots of potential with a gravitational weapon, an interesting starting story and good gameplay elements. Sadly, it cannot use this potential and seems to be that it was not enough time to finish Inversion as an exciting, well-made game.",70
6092,302,1151,7,"The potential for something strong was here- but the mediocre level design and the repetition of the mechanics, hold Inversion back from 'diamond' status.

6245,21,2830,9,"Overall, Wanted: Weapons of Fate won't win any GOTY awards, but it's still a major improvement for movie-licensed games and serves as an example for how to truly do a movie-game right.",79
6246,111,2830,9,"Like the movie, Wanted: Weapons of Fate is more style than substance. The game is at its best when Wesley is quick chaining cover with his ability to slow down time and curve bullets in the midst of overwhelming odds.",78
6247,316,2830,9,"To conclude, Wanted: Weapons of Fate is not a bad game. It's most crippling flaw is that it's too expensive for something that only lasts a few hours.",77
6248,155,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate, surprisingly, is not only better than a typical movie-licensed game, it’s better than a typical action game.",76
6249,320,2830,9,"A decent FPS-style shoot 'em up. The curving bullets are fun, but other than that, there's nothing special. It's a bit on the short side, too.",76
6250,193,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate continues the story of the movie and can be considered Wanted 1.5, so fans of the film and comic should definitely give the game a try.",75
6251,197,2830,9,"For fans of the film, the game is the perfect match. Folks that like action-shooters may be disappointed, because Wanted: Weapon of Fate is too linear and offers too little alternation.",75
6252,151,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate is a relatively well compiled shooter, but misses out on top marks by simply being too short.",75
6253,41,2830,9,"In Wanted: Weapons of Fate, Grin has created a definite step forward for the ""cover shooter"" genre. It features a fast-paced campaign that we had a blast playing. Again, we suspect a rental will give most players all the value they'll get from this game, but all fans of third-person shooters should at least give it a shot.",74
6254,213,2830,9,"I have nothing against short games, so long as there is proper incentive to play multiple times. Wanted lacks any such incentives. Something as simple as an arcade scoring system or in-depth stats might have been enough to make a second playthrough interesting.",73
6255,145,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate strikes one more blow against the curse of the bad licensed game, but despite unique elements and enjoyable gameplay, it doesn't quite have the polish and longevity to compete with other big-name shooters on the market.",72
6256,268,2830,9,"While the game never comes close to the level of daring and invention within that work, the good news is that it is at least on par with the film, and probably better. In the world of comic/movie tie-ins, that in itself is as unlikely as breaking the laws of physics.",72
6257,333,2830,9,"Ultimately misses more than it hits because it has so little game. [May 2009, p.76]",70
6258,387,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate is like buying a car from a shifty looking guy down an alley.

6260,194,2830,9,Wanted: Weapons of Fate doesn’t suffer from the “Bad movie-license game” curse. It is not that bad. But it suffers from being too short and not having enough after you beat it to keep on playing.,69
6261,448,2830,9,The problems arise when you realize the game is able to be finished within one sitting and there really is no reason to go back through outside of unlocking some Gamerscore.,68

6263,313,2830,9,"Enjoyable, but far too short to buy and technically a bit of a mess. [May 2009, p.70]",66
6264,178,2830,9,The biggest disappointment with Wanted: Weapons of Fate was how close they came to almost getting it right. The few shining gameplay features like the cover system and bullet curving just can’t overcome the numerous flaws the game has in just about every other department.,65
6265,365,2830,9,"Wanted; Weapons of Fate could’ve been a great action game. Gameplay is solid, even if not original, and will deeply entertain you, and graphics are sometimes stunning. The big drawback is the length: it took us four hours to get to the final sequence, which really isn’t enough as of today. Consider a purchase only if four intense hours of gameplay is enough for you.",65
6266,4,2830,9,"Wanted is a pretty decent effort, and a new example that not every cinema adaptation is condemned to failure. With a longer playthrough, a multiplayer mode and a brighter IA, Weapons of Fate could be a far better game, but nevertheless is an interesting option for action fans.",65
6267,427,2830,9,"Wanted is mediocre and too short, and it's only of vague entertainment even for players with prerequisite interests.",65
6268,228,2830,9,The short length of Wanted: Weapons of Fate is actually its rescue. If the game would have been any longer it would have gotten boring. For that reason Wanted is only recommendable for the most fanatic Wanted fans. Everyone else might give this average shooter a chance when it’s in the discount bin.,65
6269,110,2830,9,"The good news is that the game, as dull as it gets, doesn't last for more than five hours. It's quick and dirty. [Apr 2009, p.77]",63
6270,324,2830,9,"While it’s not the game of the film, which would have been one long tutorial, it still manages to be just as bad as most film licenses. Perhaps the game’s shortness is a blessing in disguise.",63
6271,91,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate, unravels the Loom of Fate a little too much as the game adaptation feels less inspired then its source material.",62
6272,140,2830,9,"This movie-inspired shooter is fun for a while, but the action becomes repetitive long before you reach the end of the six-hour story.",60
6273,199,2830,9,"It's a short game, but if it were longer, the excitement of bullet curving would probably wear off. That said, it's got some cool concepts and it compliments the film fairly well. If you can find it for less-than-full price, it's worth checking out.",60
6274,160,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate looks good and plays well. However, there isn't much that makes the game special. The tutorial teaches you some pretty amazing stuff but in the end you will hardly use any of those abilities. Besides that, there is no multiplayer mode present, making the game nothing more than average. And that's a shame knowing that the game could have been much more.",60
6275,413,2830,9,"With a license that seemed tailor made for the video game treatment and a competent developer (Grin, makers of the PC GRAW titles and the forthcoming Bionic Commando) in charge, there was a chance this would be something really rather good. What we ended up with is a perfectly passable, often enjoyable game, but not something that will be remembered once you've beaten it over the course of a few evenings.",60
6276,374,2830,9,"Due to its shortness of length, repetitive (and at times annoying) gameplay and non-existent re-play value, its hard to justify paying the full recommended retail price for it.",60
6277,293,2830,9,"A vanilla-flavoured action title that has some fun moments and is better than the average movie-to-game title. However at just five-hours long and with little incentive for multiple playthroughs, it offers poor value for your hard earned gaming dollar.",60
6278,31,2830,9,"So, the movie and the game have something in common: they try hard and have some cool, fun moments, but lack the necessary substance or flare in order to make the time between each thrill worth enduring.",60
6279,9,2830,9,Wanted: Weapons of Fate is a very stylish game that uses some very clever and entertaining mechanics and set pieces.,60
6280,332,2830,9,"Perhaps worst of all, Wanted just doesn't progress after the first couple of hours. [May 2009, p.105]",60
6281,325,2830,9,"Weapons of Fate does a perfectly serviceable job in continuing the film's story, delivering decent enough in-game likenesses and equally accomplished voice acting, but the end product just doesn't boast the level of polish we had hoped for.",60
6282,314,2830,9,"Tirelessly one dimensional. [May 2009, p.88]",60
6283,309,2830,9,"Swedish developer GRIN had obviously lots of ideas and fresh thinking going on, but the realization is poorly executed and the game suffers from lots of glitches and bugs. It still manages to give you quite some fun, even though the main storyline is far too short.",60
6284,1,2830,9,"For its six-hour playthrough (you can extend that by unlocking alternate characters, but they're so unmemorable and non-gameplay changing, that they provide no incentive to play through again), Wanted: Weapons of Fate is at best a competent, fire-and-forget movie game -- not much more nor less.",58
6285,136,2830,9,"It’s just boring and redundant. It’s worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed the big-screen or comic book incarnations of the franchise, but even a guest appearance by Angie herself wouldn’t make this worth full price.",58
6286,430,2830,9,"Those who have seen Wanted should certainly play this game, because the story continuous where the movie has stopped. Other shooter fans, better leave this title out. The game is too standard, and not worth 60 euro for only 3 hours of gameplay.",56
6287,7,2830,9,"Cold language of numbers is the best way to describe Wanted. 9 levels, 5 enemy types, 4 hours to complete, 2 weapons, 0 multiplayer modes, 0 ""wow"" moments, 0 thoughts about playing this game again…",55
6288,124,2830,9,"Another movie tie-in game, another poor title. Weapons of Fate had the potential to be a great game as the bullet curve system is very unique and fun to use. However, the game suffers from repetitive gameplay and barely serviceable graphics. In essence, the game doesn’t leave you wanting more – it leaves you wanting an entirely new game altogether.",52
6289,142,2830,9,"As dense and nihilistic as the source material, but not nearly as thrilling.",50
6290,132,2830,9,"All in all, Wanted: Weapons of Fate isn't so much a game for fans of the shooter genre, but it's a game for fans of Wanted.",50
6291,112,2830,9,"Wanted: Weapons of Fate tries hard to let you experience the same thrills as last year's film, but in the end, falls short of its own ambitions.",50

6301,289,2830,17,"And to top it off, it’s almost shockingly short: for a full-priced game, we expected more than four hours of gameplay with no multiplayer in sight. If it cost $40 or less, we’d be singing a different tune…",75
6302,225,2830,17,"In conclusion, Wanted: Weapons of Fate seems a tad contrived and forced and although the combat and gameplay is rather strong, the title does become repetitive midpoint. It's still fun to play but don't expect this to be the killer title of the year.",75

OK, that was a terrible analogy, but you get the picture.",72

Unfortunately, its merits get overshadowed by its four hours longevity, more adequate to a Live Arcade game than to a full price retail game.",68

6319,372,2830,17,"Wanted is an unfortunate disappointment to me, but not as much for its gameplay design, which is where a lot of games lose points. It has a nice control scheme, it has some grin-inducing comedic dialogue and more. The key argument against it is that there’s simply not enough of it—and that ends up drawing a big thumbs down from me.",66
6320,255,2830,17,"Wanted has several good ideas, and it's not a bad game on the technical side. But, overall, it seems a bit uninspired when it comes to exploit all its potential, and it's extremely short, with little replay value, just replaying the main story with different characters. Fun while it lasts, but it won't be long.",65
6321,4,2830,17,"Wanted is a pretty decent effort, and a new example that not every cinema adaptation is condemned to failure. With a longer playthrough, a multiplayer mode and a brighter IA, Weapons of Fate could be a far better game, but nevertheless is an interesting option for action fans.",65

6340,136,2830,17,"It’s just boring and redundant. It’s worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed the big-screen or comic book incarnations of the franchise, but even a guest appearance by Angie herself wouldn’t make this worth full price.",58

6373,376,1426,9,"By making every one of us the captain in our own saga, BioWare has retired the one-size-fits all of Kirk and Luke in favor of something much more flexible. Mass Effect 3 is what it feels like to be your own biggest fan.",100

Already one of the best games of 2012.",90

6394,427,1426,9,"Mass Effect 3 is not a bad game, but it doesn't feel like Bioware learned much from Mass Effect 2. If you enjoyed the previous game, there's plenty to like here, and the bad parts are easy enough to ignore. However, the problems make Mass Effect 3 a game for fans only.",85
6395,199,1426,9,"Even though it has some interesting ideas, it's hard to get excited about yet another take on wave-based survival, especially one that uses the occasionally-clumsy Mass Effect combat as its base. Once you start thinking about how most of the campaign's side content either uses these same multiplayer levels or has you performing extremely basic retrieval tasks, it's easy to start feeling slightly indignant about the whole thing...But only slightly. At the end of the day, Mass Effect 3 is a game for people who liked Mass Effect 2 so much that they absolutely need to see how it all ends. Despite claims to the contrary from the game's publisher, I really don't think newcomers will get much out of it at all.",80
6396,78,1426,9,"It's a third and final chapter, then, with all that implies. It's off-putting to new players, too busy tying up loose ends to dangle any threads of its own, and fails to stand up as its own game in the same manner as its predecessors. But it's also a spectacular, powerfully imagined and dramatically involving final act to one of gaming's richest sci-fi sagas.",80
6397,5,1426,9,"You meet old friends and you feel at home on the Normandy. But this is the weakest and most monotonous episode of a futuristic adventure that went the wrong way over time. The action is not varied enough, relies too heavily on surviving wave after wave and rarely equals the tension of shooters like Killzone or Gears of War. On all levels I missed variety and challenge. If you started this odyssey with Shepherd a few years ago, you'll want to end this nonetheless – and you won't be disappointed. But after the credits I didn't think about a possible sequel but the missing headshot statistics.",75
6398,99,1426,17,What is so unique in this game is how the presence of its conclusion feels like the existential dread that infuses the characters that make up its universe. The paradox of the game becomes painfully prescient as it draws inexorably towards its conclusion.,100
6399,82,1426,17,"As with any game that dares to be ambitious, deconstruct Mass Effect 3 into its constituent parts and of course there are flaws, but taken as a whole this is arguably the first truly modern blockbuster, a game that transcends the genre boundaries of old and takes what it needs from across the gaming spectrum in order to finish its story in the most compelling, thrilling, heartbreaking way possible. Few gaming sagas come to a definitive close, but this one signs off in breathtaking style.",100
6400,321,1426,17,"Whether you've been holding your breath since finishing Mass Effect 2 or just now looking to jump into a story-driven video game, Mass Effect 3 provides something for everyone from the single-player to co-op, it's just that f***ing good.",100
6401,202,1426,17,"More than ever, the Mass effect universe pulls off the masterful trick of feeling huge and yet believable – the game's production values are through the roof, and its third-person shooter controls incredibly precise, responsive and accurate given Mass Effect's immense scope. It really does feel like a TV sci-fi series in which you play the central character.",100

Mass Effect 3 is truly unique in this respect, leaving no stone unturned and offering full closure, yet still leaving players with countless 'what ifs'. It's these unanswered questions that have driven the Mass Effect experience, and will motivate players to see their mission through to its glorious end.",100
6407,402,1426,17,"With its grand storytelling and enthralling gameplay, Mass Effect 3 doesn't just bring an epic trilogy to a close, it rivals the most revered space operas.",100

6410,70,1426,17,"Preserving the importance of a personal story against the backdrop of a galactic catastrophe, Mass Effect 3 respects its foundation as much as it understands and indulges in the player's choices. And it does it better than anything else.",100
6411,64,1426,17,"I've never been privy to a game that caused me to wonder, question, and embrace humanity's place and purpose as greatly as Mass Effect 3.

6412,188,1426,17,"The Mass Effect trilogy will undoubtedly go down as not only some of the greatest games ever made, but may go down as one of the best trilogies ever to exist in any form of media, and for that Bioware, we thank you.",100
6413,336,1426,17,"As a bombastic action-RPG with no previous context, Mass Effect 3 is a dark, engaging game with great combat, a well-written story, and all the epic space-opera you could want. But for those who have played through Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, it's something much more.",100

6417,439,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy that manages to put the best parts of Mass Effect 1 with the best parts of Mass Effect 2. Sure, it will never be as much an RPG as the title that started it all, but as a result the game is actually, surprisingly, more fun to play and feels like a very well put together third person shooter that is bolstered by an in depth customisation system for both your weapons and your skills.",98
6418,197,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is a milestone in the history of video games. It is an absolutely fantastic end to an amazing SciFi saga and tells an absolutely enthralling story. The characters are authentic and the synchronization is great. The gameplay stayed mostly the same, though there are a few improvements in Shepard's sprinting and the cover system. The complexity of the Mass Effect universe and the variety of scenes in the game are simply stunning. This is a must-buy for everyone who loves video games.",98
6419,408,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 greatly closes a trilogy that will be remembered for years. Although it is more action-focused than the previous game, the game will please fans of the series and is a serious candidate to be the game of the year.",97
6420,260,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is a great conclusion, fully satisfying and highly spectacular, to BioWare's sci-fi trilogy. A must buy for every lover of good games and great, emotional stories, as well as the first real nominee to the title of GOTY 2012.",97
6421,432,1426,17,"The perfect ending to a masterful trilogy that's gone from strength-to-strength with each title. It's the conclusion you're hoping for, with each decision demanding that you think twice before pulling the trigger.",96
6422,124,1426,17,"The storytelling itself, the more refined combat, the voicework, the visuals, et all, stand as a fine example of some of the best this industry has to offer, and with my minor complaints aside, there's no doubt that Mass Effect 3 will be deservedly at the top of everyone's list come this year's award season.",96
6423,145,1426,17,"Improves many of the series' individual elements, and provides finality to a saga in which numbers of us have invested dozens of hours. But despite this success, it's unable to reward the effort and investment of players in the same way previous games did. Still, it handles its subject matter in a way that invites you to care, and the addition of multiplayer does add another dimension to the game. When all has been said and done, there's a very good chance that you'll feel something.",95
6424,213,1426,17,"In many ways, Mass Effect 3 has set the bar even higher as the worthy conclusion to one of the finest stories ever told in gaming history, even if it's still admittedly imperfect.",95
6425,89,1426,17,Mass Effect 3 is one of the best experiences of this generation. Fantastic character design and an immersive story define a game that everyone must have.,95
6426,250,1426,17,"What you'll remember when you're done with ME3 is not the glitches, it's the adventure and the characters you shared it with. As a trilogy, it is one of the most well-realized pieces of science fiction ever created. As a videogame, let's just say I hope I'm alive to see a series of this scope again.",95
6427,289,1426,17,"From the visceral combat to the excitement of finishing Shepard's 100-hour fight, Mass Effect 3 is a rare, magnetically engaging treat that'll compel you to stay up well past your bedtime to do ""just one more quest."" Safe travels, fellow Shepards. See you starside.",95
6428,365,1426,17,"The epic conclusion of an amazing saga. Has some annoying visual bugs and the narrative doesn't quite reach the fantastic peaks of its predecessor, but it's still an incredible production that will be remembered.",95
6429,262,1426,17,"An outstanding final chapter for a magnificent saga, Bioware simply surpasses itself with a killer ending and great gameplay. We already miss Captain Shepard and Normandy crew.",95
6430,151,1426,17,Mass Effect 3 is an utterly brilliant bookend for an outstanding franchise.,95
6431,160,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is an emotional rollercoaster ride with lots of tension and moving moments. The threat of the Reapers make every decision a hard one and your relationship with other characters will be tested. This, in combination with tight gameplay, makes this the complete experience.",95
6432,174,1426,17,"No matter your feelings on how things turn out in the end or the addition of multiplayer, Mass Effect 3 is the trilogy-capper we've been waiting for, and its an experience that can easily be recommended to nearly anyone.",94
6433,4,1426,17,Mass Effect 3 is a great conclusion of an incredible saga. No other games offer up as much as this worthy series climax with a perfect story and amazing action sequences.,93
6434,225,1426,17,I can say that Mass Effect 3 is indeed an epic conclusion for Commander Shepard's role in the Mass Effect Universe.,93
6435,320,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to one of the best RPG franchises ever. The story is gripping and gameplay-wise Bioware has fixed many of the errors they made with the second game, most importantly the renegade/paragon points work properly again and you are free to actually role play as you see fit. It doesn't quite reach the greatness of the first Mass Effect game, though. Still, a great game and a great end to Shepard's story. [March 2012]",92
6436,136,1426,17,"In the end, though, none of this simplification really matters all that much. Sure, this smaller scope may diminish the game's scale, but it doesn't diminish its impact, as Mass Effect 3 is ultimately only slightly - and not always that noticeably - less fun than Mass Effect 2 (and is still a slight bit better than the original).",91
6437,179,1426,17,"A heart-pounding, exciting, tragic, daring, but blemished conclusion to Mass Effect. [May 2012, p.69]",91
6438,77,1426,17,"Mass Effect's brilliant story remains intact, and if you played the previous two games, the payoff's more than satisfying. Some cover and combat issues remain unsolved, though, and the idea of participation in a completely separate multiplayer mode potentially influencing your single-player ending is mind-boggling.",90
6439,140,1426,17,"A remarkably satisfying conclusion to a beloved trilogy, and a poignant and memorable role-playing action game in its own right.",90
6440,226,1426,17,"The less-than spectacular combat does little to diminish what is ultimately a spectacular experience. As a finale to Shepard's quest it's fulfilling, engaging and packing enough depth to keep you very much on the edge of your seat and wanting more from the universe.",90
6441,184,1426,17,"Even if the end destination of this final chapter isn't quite as magnificent as we hoped for, we'll never regret the hundred-hour, three-game journey we took across the galaxy to get there. Mass Effect 3 is an incredible experience that rewards you for those years of investment and devotion to its stratospheric tale.",90
6442,257,1426,17,"A great ending to a landmark trilogy. A near perfect mix of action and storytelling, where the personal drama is as engrossing as the galaxy-spanning battles.",90
6443,28,1426,17,"The combat leaves something to be desired, which might diminish what you get out of playing it in 'Action' mode, but what Mass Effect 3 really sets out to do - wrap up one of the best space operas of all time - it does expertly.",90
6444,389,1426,17,"Mass Effect 3 is an action game with a side-helping of dialogue, and the finale might frustrate fans who have stuck with the series since the beginning - some might even consider it lazy. It's hard to knock the actual game; it's a great shooter and the dialogue is well acted and (mostly) well-written. Mass Effect 3 is one of the best marriages of shooter action and storytelling around, and it's up to the fans to decide if that's what they really want.",90
6445,451,1426,17,"While it's not a total triumph, the core of what Mass Effect 3 achieves is an engrossing, fabulously put together piece of work, regardless of an ending that will delight as many as it dumbfounds.",90
6446,157,1426,17,"While I don't think that this recent entry is the best in the series, make no mistake - Mass Effect 3 is still a really solid game that shouldn't be missed.",90
6447,415,1426,17,"With a gripping story, fun combat, clever dialogue and a great cast of characters Mass Effect 3 is everything we hoped it would be: an epic conclusion to a highly acclaimed trilogy.",90
6448,21,1426,7,"It may not have the sheer landmass of their just-released MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic and it might not stand the test of time quite the way simpler, more focused games like Knights or the original two Baldur's Gate titles did, but it's still a wonderful game with tons of content, great production values, a masterful eye for humor and drama, and a cast of lovable characters that BioWare has been carefully slow-playing for the last four-plus years.",100
6449,34,1426,7,"Mass Effect 3 will force you to make tough decisions on a galactic scale. You have to think them through and you feel bad about yourself afterwards. It really kicked me in the emotional equivalent of testicles. What a spectacular finale to the trilogy! [April 2012, p.44]",100
6450,348,1426,7,"Anyone who has invested any amount of time in the previous games will enjoy watching the final chapter of Shepard's tale unfold, and among the feelings of excitement and joy as they meet and fight alongside old friends for the fate of the galaxy, they will also feel just a tinge of disappointment and heartbreak as they bid farewell to the colorful universe and memorable characters BioWare has created.",99
6451,197,1426,7,Mass Effect 3 is the first contender for game of the year 2012. BioWare once again delivers a masterpiece.,95
6452,106,1426,7,Mass Effect 3 surprised me in a very positive way. BioWare has delivered an excellent product that won't allow us to forget about Normandy's crew for years to come. The trilogy's conclusion should satisfy everyone and the grand finale itself is simply perfect - you will all be awestruck.,95
6453,213,1426,7,"An absolutely amazing game, one that successfully puts a bow on the Mass Effect trilogy while still leaving us hungry for even more. It looks and plays great, but Mass Effect 3's true strength lies in its ability to tell a deeply-woven story.",95
6454,430,1426,7,"Mass Effect 3 isn't a perfect game, but what you get is one hell of a science fiction experience that you'll never forget.",94
6455,296,1426,7,"The end of the series is a mixed bag. Satisfying in some ways, nonsensical in others, and ultimately too simple. But the sheer scale of the adventure it's ending – and the music, which is gorgeous throughout – gives it an emotional impact that goes beyond its plot payload.",93
6456,140,1426,7,"Whether you possess a storied history with the series or come with a clean slate, Mass Effect 3 expertly entangles you in its universe and inspires you to care about its future.",90
6457,143,1426,7,"Wow, what a game!",90
6458,298,1426,7,"A great finale to a remarkable series. While Mass Effect 3 may not be perfect, the stirring story, smart writing and fast combat still make for an exceptional experience.",90
6459,29,1426,7,"Big, bold and ceaselessly bleak; a world where you really feel like you need the friends you've built over the last two titles. If you've come this far, it's a sin not to go further.",90
6460,302,1426,7,"The efforts to approach a broader target group by ripping to shreds ""complex"" RPG mechanics, by cutting back on dialogue options and by emphasizing the action element, are painfully obvious. But the epic scale, the magnificent direction, the different story paths influenced by options that skyrocket the game's replayability and, in general, the whole ""blockbuster"" grandeur feeling outshine the various drawbacks. [April 2012]",90
6461,142,1426,7,"By the time I reached the end, Mass Effect 3 had secured the trilogy's spot amongst my favorite science-fiction stories in any medium.",90
6462,240,1426,7,"The grand finale of one of the best sci-fi game sagas brings greater pace, monumental threat to the whole universe, dynamic action and stronger emotions. [March 2012]",90
6463,38,1426,7,"BioWare captures the scale of the conflict well, but always focuses on the people involved in it. It's pretty amazing just how badly EA disregarded the heart of the game – the characters and the world – when they began their marking blitzkrieg, but don't worry, it's oh so definitely there – Day 1 DLC, controversial endings, and questionable use of resources be damned. This is a fine, lovingly crafted game with a clear vision despite the realities of corporations and damning business practices.",90
6464,7,1426,7,Finishing a trilogy is always difficult. Tying off dozens of story threads which had been woven by players into many different tapestries is a daunting task. Mass Effect 3 is the first game that succeeded at this colossal undertaking.,85
6465,347,1426,7,"There's no debate whether Mass Effect 3 is a good game. It has good combat, an effective atmosphere, satisfying resolution, and a few great characters. Co-op is surprisingly entertaining. Bioware has finally settled on a good balance of RPG elements, too. It's easy to dismiss most of the nitpicks. It's the best game in the series for all these reasons...Instead, I argue about whether Mass Effect 3 is a great game. I write about it because I deeply care about Bioware as a developer. I want Bioware to strengthen choice and consequence and master character writing so I can consider their games to be classics again. At the very least, I'm no longer left out of this series now that I appreciate the combat and the universe.",80
6466,63,1426,7,"For a series that centers its experience around the survival of characters and the choices you've made in previous games, it does a fine job managing all sorts of variables and presents strong, emotional and – best of all – fitting conclusions to the lives Commander Shepard has influenced. There's a lot of heart and soul crammed into the story, which makes this game such a joy to play through.",80
6467,111,1426,7,"ME3 is a tough game to love, but a pretty easy one to like.",80
6468,303,1426,7,"A game that's more shooter than role-playing, and a conclusion that's more spectacular than dramatic. [Apr 2012, p.47]",80
6469,375,1426,7,"While the writing and pacing may detract a bit from what should be the most epic of space conflicts, you'll still have a good time blasting the hell out of aliens, robots, and your former employer. It just doesn't feel like as big of a step forward as the second game was from the first.",77
6470,48,1426,7,"So that's the story of Mass Effect 3, turned from potential masterpiece into a game sabotaged by greed and the „it's good enough"" approach. It's unbelievable how easy BioWare passed over the opportunity for greatness and, despite the sales, I have a feeling that their reputation as great RPG makers is going downhill fast. Especially after this ""back to back"" performance with the fiasco called Dragon Age II.",75
6471,83,1426,15,It's not as special as the title suggests. But that doesn't make it any less – or more for that matter – of a brilliant game.,100
6472,213,1426,15,Mass Effect 3 on its own is still easily one of the best games of the year – and some (like me) would argue that it's the best game in the trilogy – and that hasn't changed on Wii U. The only thing that's changed is your access to the rest of the series.,95
6473,280,1426,15,"An absolutely amazing game. The lack of sixty hours of content leading up to it does rob the story of some of its impact and many characters don't get the proper time needed to fully flesh them out, but the great writing and high stakes of the events still make the game's thirty or more hours exceptionally compelling.",91
6474,184,1426,15,"If you really, really want to play Mass Effect and simply can't get your hands on it for other consoles, the Wii U version will definitely work, and it's a fine iteration. But unless you fall into that niche, it's likely worth grabbing the games on other consoles so that you can get the full experience.",90
6475,233,1426,15,"If Mass Effect 3 Special Edition is your only shot at dipping into BioWare's universe, you may as well take it. If you've already experienced the previous games, and you don't mind missing out on importing your character, you'll find a competent port with a few novel extras.",90
6476,140,1426,15,"Mass Effect 3 retains its powerful impact on a new platform, merging action and storytelling into an exciting and memorable adventure across the Milky Way.",90
6477,448,1426,15,"Mass Effect 3 on Wii U is a tough sell. The game on its own is fantastic. The shooting is solid, the narrative is great and the characters are memorable, but you are simply missing so much of the experience by not having played the previous two. In the case that you have played them on other consoles, there is no incentive to lose your save and progress to migrate to Wii U.",90
6478,70,1426,15,"The Special Edition of Mass Effect 3 is an interesting release that those gamers with only a Wii U shouldn't miss. For everyone else, the fullest experience can be had elsewhere.",90
6479,84,1426,15,"Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U is exactly the masterpiece that we experienced on the other systems, plus some welcome new GamePad features. If there were a way to import the saved games from the previous chapters, this would have been our preferred console version.",90
6480,170,1426,15,"The differences from previous versions of the game are miniscule, but Mass Effect 3 still offers a fantastic story with grand moments. A great place to start your Wii U collection.",90
6481,365,1426,15,"A great port, with some decent gamepad functionality. A pity the previous chapters aren't on Wii U though, since the legacy comic doesn't really compensate for their absence.",90
6482,408,1426,15,"As an adaptation, it's somewhere between PS3 and Xbox 360, but one way or another it's an outstanding game. However, it's quite weird playing the end of a story, no matter how many comics we find along the way.",90
6483,19,1426,15,"All in all, those new to the franchise would be better served to pick up the Mass Effect Trilogy releases that came out at the same time and would get all 3 games for the same price. However, if you don't have access to an Xbox, PS3 or a gaming PC, this isn't the worst way to go.",90
6484,89,1426,15,"Mass Effect is also a masterpiece on Wii U, despite the fact that Bioware did not push some of the features of the New Controller in the game as strongly as we hoped.",90
6485,77,1426,15,"The same game as previously released on other systems, but the first two games of the series are glaringly absent from the Wii U. To make up for that, the developer included a motion comic to catch players up on the previous story. It's lacking, but what can you do?",90
6486,277,1426,15,"Despite the rare occurrence of frame rate drops, and the stunted online play, Mass Effect 3: Special Edition is a love letter to video game and science fiction enthusiasts everywhere, as it does all it can to please the fans and engage newcomers to its immense and beautiful universe.",90
6487,55,1426,15,"Without doubt, Mass Effect 3: Special Edition is easily one of the best offerings on the Wii U right now, but it simply cannot be stressed enough that players must seek out the two previous games in the series before playing this one.",90
6488,179,1426,15,"Still great, but the port should have had more. [Feb 2013, p.77]",89
6489,255,1426,15,"An interesting port for the Wii U, despite the unstable frame rate and minor flaws. Using the Wii U GamePad you can experience new ways of fighting against the Reapers. The game includes some interesting DLCs content, but not all of them. Mass Effect 3 Special Edition works fine if you didn't play the original game.",88
6490,197,1426,15,Despite the missing Omega DLC and the frugal use of the gamepad features Mass Effect 3 conquers the Wii U with its well-known qualities as the war for survival wages on.,87
6491,268,1426,15,"I liked Mass Effect 3 when it first released and I have to say I am liking it even more on the Wii U. Again, I think it is the graphics and the controller that do it for me.",87
6492,228,1426,15,"Mass Effect 3 Special Edition for the Wii U is a good game. The Mass Effect 3 experience was kept intact, but the new functionalities offered by the Wii U aren't anything special.",85
6493,262,1426,15,"Mass Effect 3 plays and looks nice on the new Nintendo console, but it's a must buy only for those who didn't get the chance to play it yet and only have a Wii U at their disposal: it's not the best version overall, and still it's pretty damn expensive, considering that one could get the whole trilogy on the other platforms at the same price.",84
6494,285,1426,15,"Undoubtedly the best-playing Mass Effect game so far, but you can't possibly get the full feel of the Mass Effect universe from it. One to weigh up carefully.",81
6495,204,1426,15,"While it's an excellent game, it's hard to recommend Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U unless you missed out on the series before and only have the Wii U to play it on. Even with this 'special edition' including the From Ashes and Extended Cut DLC to extend the campaign, knowing that not all of it will be coming to this version hurts its overall value. It's hampered more by the upcoming ME Trilogy release coming to both the 360 and PS3 that will allow you to get all three core games (sans DLC) for the same price as this. Given that both the PS3 and 360 versions of ME 3 go for $25 tops now, it's impossible to recommend if you own either of those systems.",80
6496,257,1426,15,"Not the best version of Mass Effect 3, but also not the worst – indeed it's only the lack of the other games and their DLC that makes this difficult to recommend.",80
6497,148,1426,15,"A correct port, which doesn't benefit as much as one would think from the Wii U GamePad touch screen. Still the only way to hold this galaxy in the palm of your hands.",80
6498,171,1426,15,The story is great and the battles are entertaining.,80
6499,430,1426,15,"A must have for every role-playing game lover. However it must be said that the version for PS3, Xbox and PC is better than the Wii U version if it comes to gameplay and graphics. The GamePad is not that innovative in this case.",80
6500,72,1426,15,"The game itself, however, is still out of this world, with Wii U users benefiting from the new and improved ending and a more efficient touchscreen control system. If this is your only opportunity to put an end to the Reaper invasion, we can't recommend the game enough, but if you access to a different gaming system, it's better to look elsewhere.",80
6501,161,1426,15,"This special edition comes with all the free multiplayer DLC, as well as the extended cut of the ending and bonus mission From Ashes. It's a pretty good package overall, and the Genesis motion comic fills in the story of the two preceding games. The inhumanly long loading screens of the Wii U version do put a damper on the experience, and Genesis skips plenty of important decisions from previous games that makes the story feel a little incomplete. But for newbies to the Mass Effect universe this is a damned good purchase.",80
6502,5,1426,15,"Why is there no release of the complete trilogy for the launch of a new console? That would have been added value. Nonetheless this is basically the same game that you can get on other systems, give or take some interesting additions as well as nagging faults: An entertaining and sometimes tragic ending to a space shooter that doesn't live up to its potential.",75

6506,111,908,7,"Freelancer’s approach and style is one of the best examples, par excellence, of the formula Chris Roberts left behind: flashy visuals, first-rate Hollywood talent fleshing out the story, and a compelling world seemingly created from scratch.",95
6507,110,908,7,"Freelancer will serve to delight and enrapture. The online portion alone is worth the purchase, but I'd be shocked if you didn't spend at least 50 to 60 hours on the single-player campaign. [May 2003, p.92]",95
6508,108,908,7,Freelancer isn’t just a game – it’s a way of life.,94

6520,19,908,7,"The game is fun, action-packed and polished to a fine sheen. Additionally, the cool multi-player element and the sheer number of missions give the game plenty of replay value.",88
6521,174,908,7,"You're left wishing that the planets were a bit more interesting after you touch down on them, though. The RPG elements are not fleshed out too well, though, so don't expect ""Morrowind"" in space.",88
6522,21,908,7,"The mixture of both story-based and open-ended gameplay comes off with a decent effect, and while the interface could have used work in some areas, it is great in others. Throw all this in together with a fun multiplayer mode, and we have a very good - but not exactly classic - game.",86
6523,48,908,7,"If we consider they worked for this game for about 4 years, a massively multiplayer add-on being cancelled 2 years ago, its presence on just one CD doesn't really justify the absence of a true nonlinear gameplay, the imbalance between the economical and military aspects, the lack of some options which are considered now a standard of the genre, the low difficulty of the game due to the poor quality of the AI and the short period of time after which both modes don't offer any more challenges.",84
6524,115,908,7,"You'll be impressed by the graphics. They don't seem as jaw-dropping as they did three years ago, but they have held up nicely and allow for an astonishing number of different ships and other space objects onscreen at the same time, which makes for some very hectic battles.",83

6537,14,908,7,"Above all else, Freelancer is a fun, enjoyable experience that both veteran and novice players can quickly get into -- even those who have never mastered the art of dogfighting in space with a joystick.",80
6538,294,908,7,"Though I loved the graphics, the vastness of space, the controls /interface and most of all, the diversity in the different systems, I didn’t care for the non-dynamic nature of the missions and lack of scripting for the characters that you run into.",70
6539,446,908,7,"Hardcore space simmers are likely to be disappointed with its lack of depth and unusual controls, but where they see shallowness and unrealism, others will see easy learning curves and familiarity.",70
6540,99,908,7,"The universe is large, but there's not much to do in it. There are infinite numbers of missions to complete, but once you've played a handful, you've played them all.",60
6541,120,908,7,"The control scheme deserves high praise, as does the evocative portrait of outer space. What doesn't deserve praise is its cloying use of randomly generated content, lack of creative mission design, and generally awkward narrative ambiance.",60
6542,78,908,7,"Remarkably compelling. But there's only so much joy to be found in repetition, particularly when dogfighting interludes are so mannered. Ultimately, it's difficult to recall what all the fuss was ever about. [May 2003, p.100]",50
6543,280,457,4,It's brief by today's standards -- finishing at 100% won't take a seasoned gamer longer than 15 hours -- but it's so addictive that you're likely to start a new game as soon as you've finished.,80
6544,281,457,4,"The game&#146;s formula is basically this: grow, attack, mate, grow, attack, mate, grow&#133; and, well you get the picture. Sometimes fighting can simply get old after a while. But besides that this game is absolutely amazing.",80
6545,323,457,4,"These oddball ""survival of the fittest"" games don't happen often, but, when they do, it's like we get to feel the drugs they were on when they made them. [Nov 2002, p.92]",80
6546,142,457,4,"Incredibly weird. While I found my time with Cubivore pretty intriguing, I'm betting that the majority of gamers will be left scratching their heads and wondering what the hell they've just witnessed on the screen.",78
6547,110,457,4,"Albeit lackluster in some categories, I give Cubivore high marks for creativity in plot, gameplay, and bad lyrical references during cut scenes. [Nov 2002, p.132]",75
6548,140,457,4,"As a game, it's slightly above average--an interesting combination of puzzle-solving and action that's plagued with camera issues and poor difficulty tuning.",73

6553,120,457,4,"From its Lego-inspired visual style to its deceptive elegance, there's a certain undeniable charm-yet the actual play is disappointingly shallow, not to mention having one of the worst camera setups I've seen in quite a while.",60
6554,99,457,4,"If you can get past the graphics and immerse yourself in the gameplay, you might be disappointed at the lack of depth.",60
6555,72,270,9,"Overall, Borderlands 2 is the sequel we were all hoping for. Gearbox has clung rigorously to what worked the first time around, and fleshed out the experience with refined customisation options, more variety, and a vastly more interesting story. With fantastic co-op support, there's tonnes of longevity on offer here, and no doubt future DLC will sweeten the deal. Looting and shooting doesn't get much better than this.",100
6556,333,270,9,"A seriously engrossing game that really, truly blends shooters and RPGs to brilliant effect. [Nov 2012, p.75]",100
6557,86,270,9,"Borderlands 2 is huge, intense and addictive.",100
6558,110,270,9,"From major bullet points like the story to smaller details like the UI and inventory system, Borderlands 2 surpassed my expectations and stands as a prime example of how to knock a sequel out of the park. [Oct 2012, p.90]",98
6559,41,270,9,"Borderlands 2 offers a much larger, much more refined version of the original. Even if complaints about the first game bothered you enough that you couldn't properly enjoy it, the second one improves on just about every aspect of the formula. And for hardcore Borderlands fans, there is a near endless amount of fan service here to keep you laughing maniacally while spearheading your own darkly hilarious co-op massacre. I'm going to wager that if you like fun, you're going to adore Borderlands 2. Cheat Code Central (http://s.tt/1nPoA)",96
6560,329,270,9,"Borderlands 2 is by far a giant leap ahead compared to its predecessor, but it's also one of the greatest games to finish off this generation of consoles. You'll get lost under enormous piles of loot, a good-enough story that's surpassed by side missions, and an absolutely hilarious cast of characters. This all comes together in a giant package of joy.",95
6561,89,270,9,"Borderlands 2 hits the market like a bullet in the brain, a syringe of adrenaline, a punch in the wall. You'll get caught and won't stop playing for a long time.",95
6562,286,270,9,"It appears there is more to Pandora than just the monotone dried-out scrapyard we saw three years ago. Not only is there more scrapyard to be explored than ever before, it has also become much more varied. From green grassy meadows to rocky mountain villages and cold snowy fields. [October p.56]",95
6563,316,270,9,This is some crazy bang for your buck and you won't regret a second of it.,94
6564,213,270,9,"An excellent shooter no one even remotely curious should overlook. Prepare to level. Prepare to loot. Prepare to get lost in the hilarious, bizarre and wonderful world of Pandora.",90
6565,332,270,9,"Borderlands 2 is a top-class FPS that perfectly captures that 'shooting things is fun' rush into an endless cycle. The game it most reminds me of is Doom: it recreates that lost-in-the-moment, circle-strafing intensity perfectly, so that you never get bored of it...If you're tired of brown military shooters and crying out for something different, then get involved – this is one of the most imaginative and rewarding blasters of the year.",90
6566,328,270,9,"The only trouble with Borderlands 2, on a critical level, is that it feels less like a true sequel than a Borderlands 1.5, a redux of the original title that lacks in completely new ideas but still clearly has all-around improvements.",90
6567,115,270,9,"Though Borderlands 2 doesn't shoot for the stars, it does more than enough to retain our most awesome recommendation. As long as you have several friends who can join your party, there's no way you will be disappointed.",90
6568,387,270,9,"A joyful experience, full of humour and character. It manages to walk the fine line between silly base humour and a more intelligent wit too, which is something almost unique in videogames. With a narrative that expands on the original storyline in every conceivable way and so many ways to play, different characters to build and so much cooperative fun to be had, it's hard to see a downside.",90
6569,324,270,9,"Where Borderlands was 'sent out to die', Borderlands 2 has been sent out to kill. And it does just that. It will easily be one of the best games released all year and the more we dream of that delicious four-player co-op, the more we think it's one of the top games this generation.",90
6570,326,270,9,"A fantastic game everyone should give a try. Be warned, though - you might just end up losing a big part of your social life and spend it (literally) walking around the vast continent of Pandora.",90
6571,268,270,9,What I like about Borderlands 2 is that the game can be as complicated or straightforward as you like.,90
6572,331,270,9,"Borderlands 2 is smarter, sharper, bigger and funnier than the game it supersedes. Everything that made the 2009 title so memorable has been improved upon, designed for you to sink your life into. These coming months are going to be packed with excellent titles, but Borderlands 2 has enough potential and sheer stuff to keep you going well into 2013. You need this. [November 2012, p62]",90
6573,225,270,9,"There is a lot to do in Borderlands 2, and even finishing the main story opens up additional quests, and the possibility to go back and pursue any side-quests that may have been missed the first time around. If there is one thing the game delivers in spades apart from its quantity, it's fun.",90
6574,389,270,9,"It's a lengthy adventure full of personality, an endless plethora of weapons, and addictive co-op gameplay. Fans of the first game would be foolish to pass up another chance to visit Pandora and plunder the incalculable treasures therein.",90
6575,186,270,9,"What the original Borderlands did so well has been grabbed and near perfected with this sequel. The comedy may be hit and miss, but it thrives on its shooting and loot grabbing. Many hours of fun will await you in Pandora.",90
6576,140,270,9,"Borderlands 2 doesn't reach far beyond its predecessor's scope, but it does do almost everything better. Additions, refinements, and fixes all combine to create an appreciably improved experience, one that fully delivers on the promise of the first game.",85
6577,313,270,9,"Light on story and heavy on guns, Borderlands 2 is saved from XP strip-mining by a sharp sense of humour and a slick, destructive multiplayer. [Nov 2012, p.90]",85
6578,199,270,9,"As someone who went into Borderlands 2 with a sickness that I thought only more Borderlands could cure, I'm left feeling like I didn't receive a full dose this time around.",80
6579,345,270,9,"Borderlands 2 doesn't quite recapture the same sense of wide-eyed wonder that made its predecessor such a commercial smash-hit, but it's still a dangerously addictive game.",80
6580,99,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a better game than Borderlands in every imaginable way. Scoff at anyone who calls it a v1.5 update; this is really what a sequel should be. At the most basic level, you've got the same great experience that the 2009 game offered, only with much more depth and variety.",100
6581,202,270,17,"Pandora feels more like an actual place than a virtual battleground, thanks to Gearbox's attention to detail in this game...I mean, when was the last time you cared about the name of any gun manufacturer in any shooter you played recently? Listen, I've played the heck out of the COD: MW titles, and I've used a TAR-21 more times than I care to mention, but I couldn't tell you who manufactured it... The gun-makers in Borderlands 2 don't even exist, for goodness sake, and I'm already brand-loyal to one of them.",100
6582,28,270,17,"It's expertly paced, cleverly written, gorgeously refined and beautifully executed. What surprised me the most is the sheer level of detail involved. Personalised character elements, the duel for loot system and the depth of your skill tree customisation makes playing for yourself more satisfying than ever. Symbiotic AI and meta-challenge systems give you more reason to fight on. And a combination of loot-chasing and story make Borderlands 2 a must own.",100
6583,226,270,17,"Bigger, crazier and more diverse than original. A role-playing shooter that raises the bar for both RPGs and shooters. Wonderful.",100
6584,347,270,17,"I'm not terribly surprised that the studio that made the first Borderlands has created such a wildly good gunplay-based action RPG. But I'm surprised that the studio that stitched together Duke Nukem Forever and all those Brothers in Arms games has also made it such a joy to discover for reasons other than the awesome guns and gunplay. Bravo, Gearbox.",100
6585,110,270,17,"With its unmatched co-op gameplay, intense shootouts, addictive loot collecting, expansive skill customization, hilarious dialogue, and insane level of difficulty, Borderlands 2 is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of this console generation. [Oct 2012, p.90]",98
6586,179,270,17,"Bigger. Ballsier. Bullet-ier. Borderlands 2 is the antidote to stuffy military shooters. [Nov 2012, p.64]",95
6587,77,270,17,"Damned impressive, standing head and shoulders above the original and other games in the genre as the most addictive, engrossing co-operative FPS game of this generation. A bona fide game-of-the-year candidate.",95
6588,192,270,17,Borderlands 2 takes the franchises's successful formula of tons of guns and absurd humor combined with enough bells and whistles to make you drool like a dog at feeding time and simply updates it instead of changing it completely.,95
6589,157,270,17,"Overall, I found myself stopping to smell the roses on a number of ocassions, attempting to raise my Badass Rank just for fun. Even in the more run-of-the-mill areas or quests you might encounter during the game, these challenges help keep things interesting.",95
6590,151,270,17,"It's a game for gamers, and a stark reminder that often the best games aren't those that set out to redefine the medium, or seek dour creative legitimacy, but those that set out to entertain, to make us laugh, to surprise us, and make such an impression that we'll return to them for years to come.",95
6591,408,270,17,"Bigger, longer, better, funnier, and the list goes on and on. It comes closer to perfection, and even though there's still room for improvement, Borderlands 2 will be one of those game we'll remember in a few years when we think about ""the previous generation"".",93
6592,24,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a FPS/RPG fusion the rest of the videogame development world should stand up and pay attention to, because Gearbox has backed a real winner in this IP. A must-buy.",92
6593,182,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is everything fans of the original could have hoped for. No, it doesn't mess with a formula that already proved itself. Instead it supports the framework for a great role-playing game with a bigger world, while offering more customization options for its players. It's also one of the funnier games you're likely to play this year.",92
6594,145,270,17,"The story in Borderlands 2 is by far the biggest improvement. The humor and over-the-top style that was merely glimpsed in the first game are ever-present here. Strong personalities drive the experience from beginning to end, whether it's Claptrap's sense of self-importance, Tiny Tina's hyperactivity, or Handsome Jack's spiteful annoyance.",92
6595,260,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is one of the best co-op games around and more broadly one of the most enjoyable ones, thanks to the sheer variety of weapons, enemies and missions, capable to entertain the player for many hours and several play-throughs. A must-play.",92
6596,439,270,17,"I can't recall a more convincing successor than Borderlands 2, which has undoubtedly and so convincingly crushed the original to smithereens.",92
6597,432,270,17,"A fantastic sequel full to the brim with colour, verve and personality, excelling as an enjoyable shooter with involving RPG elements despite more fetch quests than several dogs will experience in a lifetime. It's all wonderfully well-executed and fun to play.",91
6598,188,270,17,"Overall, despite a small number of flaws, Borderlands 2 is well worth picking up. It provides the same action packed, RPG style experience found in the original game, spread across a larger world with lot more stuff to do and explore.",91
6599,320,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a marvelous sequel. Its unique style, vast world and funny characters draw you in, its hectic combat and endless supply of loot cause addiction. Superb audio-visual quality and smooth co-op are only the topping on the cake. Borderlands is one of the best games of 2012. [Oct 2012]",91
6600,213,270,17,"A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you've been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.",90
6601,290,270,17,"The words ""awesome"" and ""badass"" are used a lot in this game, but Gearbox has earned the right. When you gunzerk into a crowd of bandits, get killed, and your shield's nova kicks in, wiping everyone out and bringing you back to life, you'll think so too.",90
6602,37,270,17,"At the end of the day Borderlands 2 is a game that should be played, as the fun factor is high, the addictiveness is through the roof, and the game provides hours of gaming entertainment.",90
6603,289,270,17,"Borderlands 2 features an insane amount of content. Expect to spend at least 40 hours finishing the main story campaign, and much more than that to complete all the optional missions. Once you beat the campaign, you can replay the game in harder Vault Hunter mode with your veteran character for even better loot and rewards.",90
6604,233,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is full of memorable moments and silly, crass folks – and if those silly, crass folks happen to be your friends, it's easily one of the best co-op experiences out there, and one of the best games I've played all year.",90
6605,255,270,17,"Borderlands 2 improves on all the elements that made the first one such a big surprise, offering a fun and complete package. Great for solo, absolutely fantastic in co-op.",90
6606,413,270,17,"On paper, this sequel reads much the same as the original. But it's not - it's a vastly superior game with a sharper focus, better quests and more enjoyable blasting. Borderlands 2 is a gamer's game, so if you like shooting things, levelling up and exploring every cubby hole across a massive, varied world - if you love games, basically - then it's definitely for you.",90
6607,250,270,17,"The wacky world that Gearbox has built really shines in Borderlands 2. It doesn't just work as a means to deliver funny lines of dialogue, though. Here is an established universe providing ample free reign to contrive silly gameplay mechanics that defy both first-person shooter and role-playing game conventions in way that has me convinced we'll be seeing a lot more Borderlands in the future.",90
6608,146,270,17,"If we were to level any specific criticisms about Borderlands 2 it would be the whole guns thing. Yeah, we get it, the game has all the guns ever, but to be honest a lot of them are pretty samey, with maybe a new adjective or stat change here and there.",90
6609,4,270,17,"It's clear that GearBox wanted to attract the undecided gamers, and they've done it in the best possible way with Borderlands 2. Multiplayer cooperative fans should all head to Pandora.",90
6610,160,270,17,"'Shoot me in the face! Shoot me in the face! Come on, shoot me IN THE FACE!', a maniacal guy shouts at us passionately. A neck shot and dead body later, the message appears on screen: congratulations, mission accomplished. It's moments like these that show that Borderlands 2 has found its voice. One filled with uncontrolled anger, sudden mania, crude humor and lots of depth. The planet Pandora will keep anyone in its grip for at least thirty hours with intense shoot-outs, bizarre side-quests and crazy characters.",90
6611,78,270,17,"Borderlands 2 might not develop extensively on its forebear, but it has even greater power to hold you for hours on end, deftly weaving RPG stat development with skill-based play. It's enough to make every decision you make meaningful and fun, and lend the realisation that Gearbox knows more about the fundamentals of the shooter than almost any other developer.",90
6612,84,270,17,"An epic sequel with a compelling, entertaining, long-lasting single player and one of the finest co-op experiences of all time.",90
6613,87,270,17,"Gearbox takes all the good ideas from the first game and tweaks everything to produce a great sequel. Guns, a better story, more guns, nice character progression and even more guns make Borderlands 2 one of the finest games of this year.",90
6614,321,270,17,"The sound design isn't going to do much for you if you're not a fan of the direction electronic music has taken these days, but I personally feel that the game's soundtrack is of incredible quality and matches perfectly with Borderland's style and how it plays. It's intense, powerful, edgy and exactly what a videogame of this caliber needs in order to stay immersed with the atmosphere.",90
6615,378,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a denser, richer version of it's predecessor, never compromising on the gunplay that made the series worthy of a sequel.",90
6616,228,270,17,"Borderlands is an amazing collection of bizarre weaponry, hectic fights and great humour. The different environments, crazy weapons and unique skills keep the game fresh from start to finish. The game might have been better off with a slightly lower pace when playing alone, but this is easily outweighed by the fun you'll have when playing with a friend. If you're going to buy just one cooperative game this year, let it be Borderlands 2.",90
6617,257,270,17,An evolutionary improvement on the original and by consequence one of the best co-operative first person shooters ever made.,90
6618,197,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a role playing game combined with a shooter, including a Bazillionen weapons and enemies, with an extremely brilliant cel-shaded look. This and tons of loot are guaranteed to captivate the player to the screen.",90
6619,129,270,17,"It's bigger, better and more addictive than ever. If you loved the first one, you simply can't miss Gearbox's latest game.",90
6620,186,270,17,"Borderlands 2 is a must have, whether you have played the original or not, it adds plenty of new content and offers up enough change to be worth the purchase. Having the weight of expectancy on its shoulders hasn't done any harm and it certainly lives up to the hype.",90
6621,428,270,17,"It's probably one of the best co-op games you'll ever play. [Issue#90, p.72]",90
6622,52,270,17,"For fans of the original Borderlands this will be a must buy, but for those who are still on the fence, it's time to come down. Borderlands 2 has everything that made Borderlands great while improving on the things that players found dull in the first game – most notably the bland environments. Although we are going to see a lot of games releasing next month, if you still haven't picked up Borderlands 2, I would highly suggest you go out and grab it right now!",90
6623,161,270,17,"Recycling weapons has never been this fun. Borderlands improves and expands on everything in the predecessor. It's bigger, better and even more hilarious than anything you could have hoped for.",90
6624,111,270,17,"In the end, I have to say that Borderlands 2 serves as a wonderful example of how to make a sequel work.",89
6625,448,270,17,"Nothing about it screams revolution of the series, but at the same time, it remains a fairly fantastic experience. If looting and shooting for 30 hours sounds great to you, and you enjoy the shooting mechanics, it is a no-brainer. Playing with friends is a blast, and the humor is outstanding. This is a finely crafted sequel that will likely impress all fans of the original.",88
6626,430,270,17,"Forget Borderlands. Borderlands 2 is so much better. The game, which combines shooter elements with RPG-elements, provides action, humor and a lot of diversity. It's a shame that the story is too hard to follow but nonetheless the game stays strong. Not to forget it's got an really addictive element in it: loot!",88
6627,415,270,17,"If you love to laugh and shoot at the same time, Borderlands 2 is for you. The remarkable humor oozes through the whole 40 hour long game and is the glue that keeps the otherwise not-so innovative game together. Gearbox managed a pimped version of the original game but dared not to try something new.",86
6628,140,270,17,"Borderlands 2 doesn't reach far beyond its predecessor's scope, but it does do almost everything better. Additions, refinements, and fixes all combine to create an appreciably improved experience, one that fully delivers on the promise of the first game. While Borderlands felt empty at times, this sequel is bursting with content and brimming with life, making it an absolutely delightful way to spend hours and hours and hours of your free time.",85
6629,10,270,17,"The only downside here is that at some point the game may still feel like you're going through yet another generic loot fest, ultimately offering very little substance to those gamers who expect a richer story and a connection with the in-game characters.",84
6630,21,270,7,"The world's bigger and badder, the visuals are more impressive, the best characters return alongside plenty of great new ones, and the endless search for new loot proves to be even more addictive than before. Borderlands 2 on PC is just plain awesome and will definitely be one of my candidates for Game of the Year.",100
6631,210,270,7,"Builds on the foundations of the first game to produce an experience that is both hugely enjoyable and technically impressive. [Nov 2012, p.59]",100

6633,106,270,7,"Borderlands 2 is a complete, exceptional game. A perfect example for other developers on how to make sequels. Not only does it have a well made, very long campaign that can be completed solo or in co-op mode, but there are lots of smaller and bigger changes and tweaks that make the gameplay so much more enjoyable. All the things that were imperfect before are better now. I have a feeling that there won't be a better game this fall.",95
6634,230,270,7,"Funnier and brilliant, Borderlands 2 is twice as good as the first episode was, something which isn't always the case for sequels. But Gearbox Software manages to improve their IP in many ways, offering one of these titles you could not possibly forget to buy in 2012, and proposing new features that will allow players to blow off some steam for hours.",95
6635,89,270,7,"Borderlands 2 is an hybrid video game that successfully combines the dynamics of first-person shooters with the depth of role-playing game. With an Unreal Engine 3 in better shape than ever, the new game from Gearbox Software is visually astonishing.",95
6636,195,270,7,"If you like piles of guns, lots to do and shoot, and a robust leveling system with a natural coop multi-player aspect and aren't put off by the cel shading, it's a no-brainer.",94
6637,375,270,7,There's really only one conclusion to be made with Borderlands 2. Despite its flaws it really is some of the best co-op gaming you're likely to see in recent years.,94
6638,174,270,7,The moment at which my endearingly annoying robot companion Claptrap fashioned himself a Mohawk out of some animal fur I collected he earned a spot on my all-time favorite robot list.,94
6639,427,270,7,"Overall, Borderlands 2 takes what wasn't broken and builds on it, but it does so in a way that feels very much like the original game. At the same time, the gameplay is different enough to not feel like a retread, as practically every area of the gameplay has been tweaked to some extent.",92
6640,302,270,7,"It’s addicting, full of creative gags and amazing battles (especially in co-op mode) and it keeps dangling that loot-carrot in front of your face. Add that crazy humor on top and you have a synonymous for the world ‘entertainment’. [November 2012]",92
6641,213,270,7,"The one thing worth pointing out between the various platforms is how cool Borderlands 2 can look if you have an awesome PC. The PC version allows plenty of tweaks to draw distance, frame rate and more.",90

6898,1,2664,8,"Arguably the greatest light-gun game ever created, and the PlayStation 2 version is the best conversion imaginable. It plays beautifully with the GunCon 2, which is thoughtfully packed in for a reasonable price.",85
6899,111,2664,8,"Just as fun at home as it is in the arcades. The ""arcade experience"" has been faithfully recreated, with every polygon in place and the challenge level intact, and the diehard shooters have already bought a copy.",85

6901,213,2664,8,"As shooting games go, Time Crisis 3 is a stellar example of what can be done. Unfortunately, as a shooting game, its replayability is inherently limited. It will be a lot of fun for a few hours, but will quickly grow old.",84
6902,323,2664,8,"Some powerful new weapons have been added in TC3, along with some additional side quests and detail tweaks to the gameplay, but this is still the same Time Crisis you know and love. [Dec 2003, p.84]",83
6903,395,2664,8,"One of the best light-gun shooters you&#146;ll find on a console. The gameplay is addictive, the GunCon2 controls are unmatched, and the overall feel of the game is just right.",83
6904,427,2664,8,"The lack of a foot pedal or a gun with recoil is probably the only things that make the arcade version better than the home version, since the rest of the game as a whole seems to have made the transition 100% intact.",83
6905,108,2664,8,It&#146;s not the prettiest game on the PS2 and it&#146;s over almost as soon as you start. It has a nice two-player cooperative mode and plenty of single-player bonus games that give it some added life.,82
6906,99,2664,8,"Delivers only so much replay value. But unlockable game modes and novel bonuses minimize such limitations. While far from perfect, Time Crisis 3 has been a long time coming, and brother, take it from us, this sucker's been worth the wait.",80
6907,66,2664,8,"Sadly, the two player mode takes a really hard hit in the end, as the split screen view offers up a very difficult view of the action; but if you have an iLink cable and an extra TV and PS2, the game can be a lot of fun.",80
6908,82,2664,8,"If you fancy some utterly ridiculous, relentless twitch gaming action, full of drama, evil henchmen and a posse of minions to pump full of lead, then Time Crisis 3 stands as an essential purchase.",80
6909,317,2664,8,"The enhanced visual eye-candy (prettier explosions you won&#146;t find on another light gun game, PS2 or otherwise) and solid frame-rate more than compensate for the now-grating voices and repetitive music that share speaker space with some pretty cool shotgun blasts.",80

6916,78,2664,8,"Another decent GunCon arcade experience from Namco, which shoots all of the (now very familiar) lightgun game boxes. Fun for a while, certainly, but there are no surprises. [Dec 2003, p.107]",60
6917,41,2664,8,I've scored it low in the Overall category simply because it's a relatively short game and some of the cutscenes aren't all that great. Not to mention that the premise is anything but innovative.,50
6918,430,571,9,Without a doubt: DiRT Showdown will be the best racing game for this year. Because you will laugh your ass off during the multiplayer and won't be able to put down the controller.,93

6923,262,571,9,"Dirt Showdown is no doubt a very entertaining game. The handling is very easy, but the destruction derby mood of the game could be a little bit frustrating.",80
6924,345,571,9,"DiRT purists will feel put off by Showdown's unruly sense of style, but Codemasters is clearly coveting a different audience with its latest jaunt on the race track. Slick multiplayer and an outstanding roster of activities make for an enjoyable ride, even if it is a predominantly exhausting one.",80
6925,140,571,9,Dirt Showdown is a satisfying mix of driving tricks and destruction wrapped up in the slickest of presentations.,80
6926,86,571,9,"DiRT Showdown has many strengths and demonstrates the power of Codemasters in producing solid racing games. It is effective, fun and easy to pick up.",80
6927,427,571,9,"DiRT Showdown seems like it wasn't made for the die-hard DiRT enthusiasts. The DiRT physics give the game a more realistic slant, but the de-emphasis of more traditional rally racing will drive away series fans.",80

6932,110,571,9,"Despite Showdown's limitations, as it has with its other games, Codemasters has provided this title with a solid foundation. The handling of the cars is thankfully easier than the base Dirt series (including in the Hoonigan events), and the balancing on the Boost ability is great. Codemasters' first try at this offshoot series is decent. It's limited more by its execution than its premise.",75
6933,188,571,9,"Overall, I feel like DiRT Showdown is definitely worth checking out, but it's certainly not on par with the experience that DiRT 3 delivered for me. The demolition modes are great additions here, but everything else just feels like tacked on, recycled content that I've already played in DiRT 3. Still, even recycled, that content manages to be just as fun as I remember it. So, unless you're particularly burnt out on DiRT at the moment, I definitely think you should give Showdown a chance, and I think you'll find that it's worth checking out.",75
6934,329,571,9,"Shortcomings aside, Codemasters has delivered a very fast paced, slickly presented, arcade demolition derby that is more than capable of giving you some great entertainment value.",75
6935,332,571,9,"It's got multiplayer appeal that deserves a busy community, pick-up-and-play appeal for the casual speedster, and a clear sense of character that gives even experienced players a genuine challenge (and a unique play style). So while it stands out for lack of serious competition rather than ingenuity, new Dirt is nonetheless a show worth buying a ticket for.",70
6936,387,571,9,"DiRT Showdown is very much a game of two halves. The single-player is enjoyable and frustrating in equal measure, but it's the online mode that swoops in and saves the day with the combination of RaceNet, Showdown Challenges and lag-free mayhem.",70
6937,333,571,9,"It's a good start in the right direction, but anyone with a copy of Dirt 3 already on their shelves will probably be content with a rental. [July 2012, p.82]",70
6938,129,571,9,"With Showdown Codemasters makes a 180 degrees turn towards the American audience. It&#700;s not a bad game by no means, but it&#700;s also not a ""DiRT"" game.",70
6939,389,571,9,"Dirt Showdown, is a curious deviation for the series, and one I happily experienced, but I was left hankering for what came before.",70
6940,331,571,9,"While Codemasters have made this look the goods from the glossy cars to the vibrant environments, the edge-of-your-seat events are few and far between, and the carnage is limited due to a small field of competitors. You'll either feel indifferent to its attitude or loathe it outright, and your gut reaction will tip you either way. We, and we suppose many others, will be curious to see how this sideshow influences DiRT 4. [July 2012, p76]",70
6941,286,571,9,"The meter onscreen tells us that our car is a tiny bump away from the scrapheap, but it still drives like it just rolled out of the factory. A serious handicap in a game where carnage and damage is almost everything. [June 2012, p.88]",69
6942,213,571,9,Showdown may look heavy on options from its bombastic menus but ultimately it just feels like a narrow slice of Dirt 3 with some destruction derbies tacked on.,60
6943,148,571,9,"Here we are. We haven't really been sold on this DiRT 3 spin off. Yes, the envelope is gorgeous, with superb car models, nice lighting effects, and a perfect frame rate, but in the end it still feels a little dull. The races are stringed together without any real thrill, and overall, we're underwhelmed. Throw in some lengthy load times, and what you get is a little above-average racing game, despite some nice multiplayer stuff.",60
6944,34,571,9,"As all Codemasters' racing games Showdown looks great but it doesn't make it exciting and will not keep you in front of the TV for a long time. You'll be better off digging up good old Burnout Paradise. [July 2012, p.74]",60
6945,289,571,17,"Varied events, sparkling social challenges, and rowdy online skirmishes make Dirt Showdown the rare spinoff that's as amazing as its much-loved predecessor, albeit in its own unique way. It's an absolute blast throughout, and proof that accessible, arcade-style thrills and spills can still deliver via superb execution.",90
6946,321,571,17,Not since the old days of Psygnosis' Destruction Derby games have we been able to really go in and trash cars for the sake of trashing cars.,90
6947,37,571,17,Do not be fooled by Showdown coming just a year after Dirt 3. This is an excellent game that easily stands on its own. If you are looking for an accessible title to play alone or with friends all the while having an absolute blast then Dirt Showdown is a no brainer purchase.,88
6948,432,571,17,"Codemasters has delivered once again with DiRT Showdown. It's another superlative racer, even if it is a little one note. Unapologetically brash, bold and loud, DiRT Showdown is Codemasters' racing id unleashed. And it's freakin' great.",85
6949,145,571,17,"Dirt Showdown is certainly a different type of racer, trading bumpy wheel-to-the-road driving mechanics for the dents, scrapes, and screams of vehicular mayhem. In some ways, it feels more like an expansion pack than an all-new game, but if you don't take this departure too seriously, it makes for some great summer parties online.",85
6950,111,571,17,"In the end, DiRT Showdown is an outstanding game and probably the most polished demolition-style racer out there. Online play is surprisingly smooth, and outside of relatively small issues like needing login data for Youtube and Codemasters' own Racenet service nearby, there isn't much I didn't enjoy about the experience as a whole. It's definitely a worthwhile purchase for either fans of the DiRT franchise or of demolition racers in general.",85
6951,255,571,17,"The ""Showdown Tour"" is long enough to have hours of fun and it can be played on three different modes: ""Destruction"", ""Style"" and ""Race"". Multiplayer mode played online is essential to have a good experience with that game.",83

6956,415,571,17,"The events in Dirt Showdown are literally hit & miss. While the lap-racing is rather dull and hardly engaging, the car-wrecking Rampage and Knock-Out modes make you giggle like a schoolgirl and swear like a sailor. But only in multiplayer does the game lives up to its full potential. Compared to the fabulous Dirt 3, the Showdown spin-off feels like a setback.",80
6957,140,571,17,"If you're looking for the next great rally simulator, you won't find it here. But to ignore Dirt Showdown because of its arcade styling would be to deny yourself one of the most satisfying of pleasures: that of mindless, over-the-top, and--above all--deliciously addictive destruction.",80
6958,82,571,17,"You'll love pretty much every minute, and then you'll move on, and the 'downloadable game' suspicion will suddenly make sense: Dirt Showdown's wonderful, but it's probably also a flash in the pan. As long as you know that going in, then you shouldn't be disappointed.",80
6959,78,571,17,"Showdown is not just a party game, nor is it the limp refurb you might expect this late in a console life cycle. It feels like something as crucial to Codemasters Racing as any of its predecessors – less a spin-off than a deliberate change of tack.",80
6960,250,571,17,"For longtime fans of the DiRT games, especially those who appreciate its realistic approach to rally racing, Showdown is an abomination, an overly simple sell-out, or a bad joke of a spin-off... But for fans of off-road racing games who want something more forgiving than DiRT but still somewhat rooted in reality, or someone wishing Forza Motorsport 4 had some off-road races and a demolition derby or two, Showdown is anything but a bumpy ride.",80
6961,84,571,17,"DiRT goes wild! With this hilarious spin-off, Codemasters puts the fun in front of every simulative ambition, dishing out a game that brings back memories of the first two Destruction Derby, mixed with the award winning Codies unique style.",80
6962,374,571,17,"An extension that creams off the outwardly silly side of throwing cars around muddy tracks, and packages it up in a bright, boisterous party bag. It may lack a little single-player finesse, but then, you can't have a shindig without a crowd.",80
6963,408,571,17,"DiRT Showdown offers an arcade experience that follows the path taken with Dirt 2 and Dirt 3, leaving the simulation part of the series. Those looking for something that resembles the original gameplay of the Colin McRae series should keep searching, but if you are looking for fun arcade races this is your game.",80
6964,202,571,17,"DiRT Showdown isn't going to change the world – it's a frothy, tongue-in-cheek driving game with pretensions towards nothing beyond providing entertainment. But it does that in spades, with considerable technical accomplishment.",80
6965,186,571,17,"If you are after an arcade racer that doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is for you. It won't suit everyone, but as a package it offers plenty for those who want to dive in. The is plenty of content across all the available modes and the introduction of RaceNet should keep the dedicated entertained for a long time.",80
6966,72,571,17,"DiRT Showdown is not just a spinoff of DiRT 3, and that is not because DiRT 4 is in development deep within Codemasters. The game is a deliberate shift in the DiRT series to a new direction, without upsetting core rally fans by changing or dropping the trademark precision racing. It could be said that DiRT Showdown is to DiRT what the Zombies mode is to Treyarch's Call of Duty; fun, violent and never takes itself too seriously.",80
6967,88,571,17,"Colin McRae once said 'if in doubt - flat out' and that's what DiRT Showdown is all about. It's not about playing nice, but rather to put the medal to the metal straight in to a concrete wall. The spirit of Colin McRae lives on in the games from Codemasters Racing and they have once again delivered an amazing racing experience.",80
6968,64,571,17,"Dirt: Showdown is a different kind of Dirt. It's a more raw and dirty Dirt that takes itself less seriously, but allows for people to have much more fun with its stress-free handling, arcade style gameplay and joyous destruction.",80

6974,5,571,17,"If you like your races rough and tough and are not afraid to put scratches and dents onto the paint, this one is definitely for you. But be aware that this showdown is some sort of recycling machine where DiRt 3 players will recognize Gymkhana and the majority of the locations.",77
6975,41,571,17,"It almost feels as if developer Codemasters wanted to take the series in an exciting new direction, but they also wanted to play it safe.

7078,84,326,10,"Advanced Warfare isn't the revolution Call of Duty needed. Exo movements are a lot of fun in multiplayer, but are underused during the campaign. Exo survival is not as strong as Zombie modes or Spec Ops. Yet this episode is the most original in recent years.",80

7090,238,326,10,There’s no way to take back what it has said in the past—its trivialization of history with Black Ops and shift toward jingoistic chest-thumping in Modern Warfare 2 and 3—but in Advanced Warfare’s recognition of death as a by-product of war there is a chance for a new way forward.,78
7091,403,326,10,"Advanced Warfare executes the formula competently while adding a handful of bells and whistles like mechs, laser cannons, and double jumps; but Sledgehammer Games seems reluctant to really cut loose and push the setting to its fullest potential, making Advanced Warfare a solid but ultimately unexciting entry in the series.",70
7092,391,326,10,"Advanced Warfare brings some new elements to the experience that make it stand out, but some of these changes only serve to remind us how rigid the Call of Duty box is, and how unwilling the franchise is to think outside it.",70

7097,336,326,18,"For whatever minor missteps Advanced Warfare makes with its story, it more than compensates with vision and remarkable execution. The latter has never really been Call of Duty's problem — Ghosts notwithstanding — but Advanced Warfare adds enough and moves far enough forward with its new abilities to feel like a risk. Turns out, that's just what the series needed.",90
7098,110,326,18,"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare’s single-player campaign is a ridiculous summer movie romp with sobering visions of the future of weaponry.

7099,432,326,18,"One of the best Call of Duty games in a while, Advanced Warfare is a triumphant effort from Sledgehammer Games, whose storytelling nous and risk-taking in introducing the Exo pays off in spades. It's not the jaw-dropping reinvention that Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was back in 2007, but Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is the shot in the arm the series needed.",90
7100,204,326,18,"Boasting the tightest multiplayer of the series and one of the strongest campaigns, Advanced Warfare proves that Call of Duty is here to stay — and it’s welcome.",90
7101,77,326,18,"If Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare’s storytelling ambitions disappoint, the same can’t be said of the upgrades to gameplay. In both campaign and single-player, the exoskeleton and other futuristic gadgetry breathe new life into a franchise that seemed increasingly trapped in the shadow of the original Modern Warfare.",90
7102,174,326,18,"Overall, Advanced Warfare delivers a complete and enjoyable Call of Duty experience.",90
7103,362,326,18,"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare offers a much more innovative take on the first-person shooter series than previous installments, but it's still shackled to the core recipe of forcing players to follow allies through set piece moments in the story campaign. The multiplayer offers a higher degree of innovation and it should certainly entertain quite a lot of fans who are open to trying the new mechanics.",90

7105,129,326,18,"This was quite the surprise. Sledgehammer Games proved that there's still ground to be explored in the Call of Duty franchise, by delivering a tight and fresh single player campaign along with the best multiplayer mode since the days of the first Modern Warfare.",90
7106,430,326,18,Advanced Warfare is the best Call of Duty in years. Kevin Spacey is brilliant and the multiplayer is just smooth. The best shooter of 2014.,87
7107,145,326,18,Advanced Warfare is Call of Duty’s true starting point for a new generation.,87
7108,10,326,18,Technically speaking the game is the best Call of Duty to date and even the story issues can’t detract from that.,87
7109,182,326,18,"It delivers with its story, great acting, dialogue, the realistic facial animations, cool weapons of the future, and the welcome change in pacing from combat missions to stealth missions. I welcome the idea of using great actors like Spacey in a big-budget game, and I look forward to future versions of the game that marry Hollywood blockbuster actors with the blockbuster-style game play.",86
7110,70,326,18,"The game is damn fun. You’ve got a bit of everything that you’re supposed to have with a Call of Duty title. An entertaining campaign mode, a fast/furious MP experience and a co-op mode that does everything you’re used to doing with a bit of a change to keep it different from previous iterations.",86
7111,37,326,18,Advanced Warfare is about the most fun I have had playing a Call of Duty game in several years. Granted it remains very familiar but the leaps are significant and in the end pay off.,86
7112,260,326,18,"Sledgehammer's debut with Call of Duty doesn't bring the revolution some hoped for, but introduces some welcome changes to the multiplayer experience making it very entertaining and compelling to play. The co-op mode is somewhat of a letdown if compared to the excellent Extinction mode from last year, while the single player campaign proved to be on par for the series even if we would have preferred more open missions and more freedom for the player. It won't disappoint any fan of the series, but it won't convert any of its detractors either.",86
7113,111,326,18,"If the regular Call of Duty formula has worn thin for you over the past couple of years, I strongly recommend giving Advanced Warfare a shot. The dramatic increase in speed makes it far more fun, and while I don’t think the parts gel as well as Titanfall, there is a lot more do to here. If nothing else, it’s worth a rental just to check out the campaign and see what multiplayer has to offer.",86
7114,24,326,18,"It’s the best Call of Duty since Modern Warfare and may in fact be better, but saying that isn’t because it’s changed the series’ formula the way that game did, rather that it’s refined it.",85
7115,195,326,18,"Advanced Warfare creates the multiplayer shooter players have been craving for years. Inspired by the old guard and incorporating a host of new features, this is the new face and bright future of Call of Duty.",85
7116,54,326,18,"It's fresh enough to the point that it's alien, yet it's still Call of Duty underneath that futuristic surface.",84
7117,255,326,18,"Power changes everything. Jetpack changes Call of Duty. The Sledgehammer team has made Advanced Warfare fresh and new. It's a frantic game with spectacular fire in the air. Kevin Spacey can be happy about his appearance, it's brilliant. Activision has rewritten the formula.",84
7118,408,326,18,"It is not a revolution, but it plays and looks great. It feels fresh, and the multiplayer mode is one of the best we've seen in a few years. If you give it a try, it might surprise you.",84
7119,228,326,18,"This game has a lot of elements that are not new, but Slegdehammer did change them a little. That is fine, although it could distract from how extremely well this game franchise is made. This is a great game, which is more dynamic thanks to the exo-suit.",83
7120,243,326,18,"With Advanced Warfare, Sledgehammer succeeds at something we thought impossible at this point: adding freshness to a washed-out formula, without breaking it. This is the best Call of Duty in years; it looks better, it plays great, and sounds amazing, even when it remains the same experience we've learned to expect. The real question now is if Treyarch and Infinity Ward will be able to emulate the same passion and creativity of Sledgehammer.",83

7122,233,326,18,"Despite the familiarity, it's been years since a Call of Duty campaign was as coherent and fast-paced as this one. Within the confines of its franchise, which has yet to make much room for a mature look at the subject matter, Advanced Warfare works with aplomb and, at the very least, plays its Big Dumb Movie card wisely.",80
7123,184,326,18,"Multiplayer feels wonderfully fresh, thanks to the added agility of Exo Suit boosting. Sadly, though, co-op is unimaginative, and the story fails to satisfy when compared to previous installments.",80
7124,72,326,18,"One excellent new addition is the option to test weapons in a firing range before games begin. Having gone into many a battle with the wrong gun in the past, this is definitely something we found useful.",80

The story might not make you wet your pants and the main character is a eccentric old prick, but the missions are cleverly designed, the interface is genius in its minimalism and the ruse system allows for strategic gameplay that one finds rarely in modern RTS. If you want to buy only one RTS this year … buy Starcraft 2. But if you want to buy two, Ruse is the game of choice!",85
7251,111,1943,7,"I'm hoping that with patches (and some more players) that most of those can be corrected, and the basic concept of the ruses is solid and very enjoyable. It really is an RTS that plays like no other, and it deserves a second look on that basis alone.",85

7256,165,1943,7,"R.U.S.E. is a fresh, fun, and fast new take on the strategy genre. The board-game philosophy combined with a competitive feel makes for a game that feels different, but still makes sure that RTS junkies will find it familiar.",80

7258,84,1943,7,"As expected the PC version of R.U.S.E. manages to assure an engaging and challenging experience to any fan of the genre. Its (maybe excessive) gameplay depth and high difficulty level might discourage any potential newcomers, but if you're not among them, Ubisoft's recent RTS will surely keep you busy for a long time.",80
7259,148,1943,7,"With a much lower pace than its competitors, in favor of its truly strategic (rather than tactical) approach, R.U.S.E. provides large-scale battles filled with subtlety, twists, and finesse, for its solo adventure and multiplayer alike. Its system of ruses, most notably, is absolutely brilliant for building up effective attack and defense strategies, especially when you're able to keep most of your real intentions concealed up to the very last minute. It's a game one needs to approach from afar, with the intelligence of a general, and a real soft gem in a world of brutish RTS games. It's a really different alternative to StarCraft II that really deserves attention, if only to discover another way to wage war.",80

7261,48,1943,7,"The great aspect is their flexibility, the how and when to use them being at your disposal. You don't get too much time to breathe in this kind of game, but overall R.U.S.E must be appreciated for having the guts to be innovative and implement its features in a way that makes them the basis of the gameplay, not just an option thrown in for the sake of it.",80

7264,41,1943,7,"A good amount of multiplayer value rounds out a substantial single-player portion. There's a good amount of game for your dollar here, but some of that is due to how slow moving the game can be at times.",76
7265,1,1943,7,"But if you stick with Ruse in spite of these things, and if you can talk some of your friends into playing from time to time, you're going to discover a thrilling new real time strategy game that belongs in the same category as EndWar, Brutal Legend, and Darwinia.",75

7270,242,1943,7,Ruse is very entertaining both in its campaign and multiplayer mode. Unfortunately the story is not very engaging and feels unnecessary. The depth of the game is what makes it different from the rest of the pack. There are lots of room for clever moves and lengthy battles.,70
7271,161,1943,7,"Although R.U.S.E. is clearly put together by quite standard RTS norms, it stands out as a strategy game with refreshing tactical elements. The singleplayer campaign, graphics and sound are a bit sloppy, but a well-built game mechanics and fun multiplayer makes it well worth playing for strategy enthusiasts as well as newcomers to the genre.",70
7272,7,1943,7,"If you're still not tired of WWII-themed RTS games, give R.U.S.E. a chance. It's a nice alternative to Order of War, but don't expect it to dethrone Company of Heroes.",67

7280,271,1398,4,"The added Super Duel Mode (which would also be good online) brings a new aspect to the title. Bottom line, despite its shortcomings, Mario Party 5 proves once again why the Nintendo Gamecube is the system to own for multiplayer fun.",88

7319,448,1588,9,"The new Reflex controls are great once you get used to them, but they also alienate the casual audience by making the game a bit more demanding than some gamers are willing to put up with. Still if you have enjoyed the series you know what to expect here.",80
7320,91,1588,9,"MX vs. ATV Reflex is a nice switch up from the more serious racers, and its fast and extremely fun off-road racing is steps above what we have previously seen.",80
7321,268,1588,9,"While it hasn’t lit my world on fire, Reflex is solid fun.",80
7322,84,1588,9,"MX vs ATV is a nice offroad game. The dynamic ground morphing system works really well, and is an important factor to study during every race. The weight management really gives the sensation of being in control of the motorbike. Thumbs down for the PS3 version, worse than the 360 one due to some graphic problems (pop-up e slow loading textures).",80

7326,174,1588,9,"There is no doubt that MX vs. ATV: Reflex is the best MX vs. ATV game I've played yet. The new controls, track damage and add-ons to the existing formula make it the only MX vs. ATV game you'll ever need – at least until the next one comes out.",78
7327,228,1588,9,"MX vs. ATV is a good offroad racer with tons of stuff to do, at least that’s the case if you drive the motorbikes and ATVs. Too bad the other vehicles are less interesting and that the game isn’t as spectacular as other offroad racers",78
7328,262,1588,9,"Maybe this is not the best motocross and off-road racing game, but with its good separate bike and rider control scheme and its dynamic ground morphing system, MX vs. ATV Reflex is one of the best product of this genre.",78
7329,310,1588,9,"MX vs. ATV: Reflex is a better part than the previous ones. It’s got nice gameplay with thanks to the new Reflex system that makes it possible to control the character and the bike to give the player a better feeling of realistic driving. The soundtrack is a bit poor and graphically it isn’t the best game. But if you like to race outdoor in the mud, then MX vs. ATV: Reflex is a nice game.",77

7334,158,1588,9,"All in all, MX vs. ATV: Reflex is a solid entry in need of expansion: the bare-boned framework is there for what can be a stellar franchise in its genre.",75
7335,192,1588,9,"There's a lot to like in MX vs ATV Reflex, particularly in the realm of controlling the rider. Still, while there is notable improvement over previous versions in some areas, there's nothing truly revolutionary in Reflex.",75

7343,332,1588,9,"It's just a shame that ploughing through the rest of the content is essentially gaming busywork. [Mar 2010, p.117]",70
7344,160,1588,9,Building MX vs. ATV Reflex from the ground up has had a positive result in a way. Rider Reflex and terrain deformation make the motocross- and ATV races very challenging. The rest of the vehicles seem to have been neglected by the developer and disturb the balance of the game during the mixed races. Despite the flaws the game will still be very much enjoyed by fans of the sport.,70

Perhaps it’s best to wait until it’s a bargain bit purchase.",69
7347,145,1588,9,"MX vs. ATV Reflex is a bit of a mess.

7352,115,1588,9,"MX vs. ATV: Reflex would benefit greatly from a diet of raw motocross action. Without the added weight of the Rider Reflex controls, the other vehicles, or its half-baked race types, this could be one lean, dirt-shredding machine.

7372,84,1588,17,"MX vs ATV is a nice offroad game. The dynamic ground morphing system works really well, and is an important factor to study during every race. The weight management really gives the sensation of being in control of the motorbike. Thumbs down for the PS3 version, worse than the 360 one due to some graphic problems (pop-up e slow loading textures).",80
7373,213,1588,17,"The controls are still great, the track design is at the top of its class and there are enough events here to keep you coming back for ages, not to mention a very solid and capable online component. If you're a fan of offroad racing, this is definitely worth a serious look, though don't go in expecting a completely different racing experience.",78
7374,41,1588,17,"Career mode is a bit on the short side, and there isn't much in the way of new challenges or modes. Still, there is a lot to do, and the new control keeps things from getting stale.",78
7375,228,1588,17,"MX vs. ATV is a good offroad racer with tons of stuff to do, at least that’s the case if you drive the motorbikes and ATVs. Too bad the other vehicles are less interesting and that the game isn’t as spectacular as other offroad racers",78

7379,372,1588,17,"Reflex isn’t quite where it should be, but it’s getting better. Here’s hoping that the next one is a more polished, cherry ride, because fans deserve that—and the franchise will certainly garner a much bigger user base if that can be accomplished.",76

7382,110,1588,17,"MX vs. ATV: Reflex features some great racing moments, but the game's technical ambitions sometimes get in its way. The possibilities of reflex racing with the right analog are clearly there, they just haven't been mastered yet.",75
7383,1,1588,17,"While the game has its fair share of annoying problems and suffers from being a bit too straightforward, it offers a solid off-road experience; motocross fans will be hard pressed to find a title better than this one.",75
7384,158,1588,17,"All in all, MX vs. ATV: Reflex is a solid entry in need of expansion: the bare-boned framework is there for what can be a stellar franchise in its genre.",75
7385,255,1588,17,"MX vs. ATV Reflex has become the best title in the series and sets up new bases in the offroad racing genre. The biggest changes in the game are the new control system, called Rider Reflex, which allows us to feel closer to the dangerous driving on these awesome bikes, and the new Rhythm Racing 2.0 graphics engine, which despite some technical failures, provides details that will probably be used in the next racing games, such as real-time deformation of the ground. Fans of these races will be pleased with this progress. Maybe other users will feel frustrated by an unbalanced difficulty curve and some graphical issues.",75
7386,89,1588,17,"No news on the arcade-racing front: same hybrid driving system, same game modes. Anyway, the formula is still fun, even if a little old, especially because of the multiplayer.",75
7387,197,1588,17,Thanks to the new control system you will definitely have some fun with this game. Action-based racing across nice tracks and weird stunts that sometimes transform your driver into a crash-test-dummy amuse.,75
7388,52,1588,17,"The increased rider control really makes it feel like you are an MX pro, skidding round the tracks like you know what you're doing. However, the improved physics can make bikes and, especially, ATVs feel like you're riding a squirrel with a sugar high as opposed to a finely tuned vehicle – a lot of fun but ultimately out of control.",75
7389,4,1588,17,"Reflex is far better than Untamed, and offers some interesting add-ons in terms of control, and is a more polished work.",74
7390,365,1588,17,"Dynamic terrain modification and the Reflex control system succeed in delivering something new to the offroad genre. On the other hand, some minor bugs and inaccuracies in physics and collisions make the experience sometimes frustrating. Add not-so-good graphics, invasive soundtrack and a clumsy customization menu and what you get is an unpolished product, suitable just for big fans of the saga and the offroad genre.",73
7391,430,1588,17,"MX vs. ATV Reflex is a solid game that meets expectations. The Reflex system is a nice addition, but besides that this game is just not special in any way.",73
7392,140,1588,17,A new dual-stick control system breathes life into what is otherwise a well-worn and sometimes frustrating game.,70
7393,160,1588,17,Building MX vs. ATV Reflex from the ground up has had a positive result in a way. Rider Reflex and terrain deformation make the motocross- and ATV races very challenging. The rest of the vehicles seem to have been neglected by the developer and disturb the balance of the game during the mixed races. Despite the flaws the game will still be very much enjoyed by fans of the sport.,70
7394,242,1588,17,"This is a title that does a whole lot right but never really manages to stand out from the crowd. The controls feel right, there are plenty of race types and vehicles and the online mode does it's job well enough. If you're a fan of moto cross you'll definitely find plenty to like here.",70
7395,289,1588,17,"Whether we were playing one of the entertaining mini-games or tooling around in Free Ride with 11 other riders, we really enjoyed the experience and didn’t experience a hint of lag. It may be the only part of MX vs. ATV Reflex that seems more timeless than retread, but it’s just enough to salvage this otherwise unremarkable racer.",60

Without the added weight of the Rider Reflex controls, the other vehicles, or its half-baked race types, this could be one lean, dirt-shredding machine. As it is, it’s a misshapen lump of flabby features and excess ideas.",58
7401,171,1588,17,"It feels like Rainbow Studios has been making the same games for a decade now, and still haven't managed to find the right formula. MX vs ATV Reflex is not a bad game, but feels really low budget and is just mediocre.",50
7402,41,1588,13,"While the annoying whine of the vehicles is pretty accurate, the crowd noise is sparse and artificial-sounding. Worst of all, the pop-metal that loops in the background is enough to make you want to huck your PSP against a wall.",66
7403,213,1588,13,"MX vs. ATV Reflex on the PSP is a disaster. The presentation is downright terrible and the controls are both touchy and unresponsive. At least it looks good, though in this case, that doesn't help at all.",40
7404,259,1588,13,"Despite its good looks, MX Vs. ATV Reflex doesn't hold up on the PSP. The controls fail to deliver, and the lack of working trick and jump systems will leave you grounded, both on the track and in spirit.",40

While it doesn’t innovate, its subtle craftsmanship and varied gameplay reasserts what we’ve always known: This genre still has something important to add to the game industry. I hope this game meets with the success it deserves.",90
7407,182,2207,9,"Sly Cooper: Thieves is Time is a fantastic addition to the series and a great entry point for newcomers. Most of my gripes are minor, but the aggressive load times present the biggest detriment to the game, and the need for a PS Vita might irritate anyone who wants to collect everything these time periods have to offer. The rest is just a few hiccups in history, but they shouldn’t stop you from enjoying the latest chapter in the Cooper story.",89

7409,197,2207,9,"Fans of the series as well as lovers of open-world jump 'n runs will be completely happy with this worthy successor. The harmonious comic style, the variety of playable characters and the many different missions contribute to a game which is just slightly let down by a certain repetitiveness in gameplay.",88

7413,111,2207,9,"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is an excellent platformer/stealth hybrid, just like its predecessors, and something long-time fans of the series will love, but newcomers may be better off picking up the HD trilogy since it doesn’t do all that much new and gives you far more value for your money.",85
7414,37,2207,9,"It doesn’t take itself too seriously and it doesn’t stretch itself out to try and be anything more than what it is, a fantastic platformer. The real kicker here, in my mind, is the low price tag. Hitting your wallet at a mere $40, please excuse the obvious pun here, you are quite literally getting a steal of a deal.",85
7415,427,2207,9,"Whether you're a longtime Sly Cooper fan or new to the series, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is really enjoyable. Story-wise, the game gets you up to speed if you missed the first three games, and the gameplay is intuitive and easy to pick up and play. It certainly left me wanting more Sly Cooper in the future, and I think you'll feel the same way after playing this title.",85
7416,188,2207,9,"After a nearly 8 year hiatus, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a worthy 4th installment in the Sly Cooper series (especially for under $40), and Sanzaru Games did a great job picking up where Sucker Punch left off.

7423,204,2207,9,"After three commendable HD ports, Sanzaru Games has done a perfect job capturing the essence of Sucker Punch’s original trilogy. Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time features not only the addictive gameplay the series is known for, but the humorous and charming tone it’s loved for.",80
7424,145,2207,9,"The Vita crossover feature allows for almost seamless alternations between portable and console gameplay; in fact, the lush visuals of Thieves in Times tend to fare better on the Vita. Yet the most satisfying achievement of Thieves in Time is that this isn’t a mere nostalgia trip like 2010’s Sly Collection; with Thieves in Time, Sanzaru has proven that there’s never been a better time to join forces with Sly and his merry band.",80
7425,316,2207,9,"The technical elements won’t blow you away, the combat can feel tedious, and the story isn’t exactly deep, but the entertainment value remains high throughout.

It’s goodhearted, lighthearted, warmhearted.",80

7427,63,2207,9,"Given it’s spot on my most anticipated games of 2013 list, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time was more or less what I was looking for. While it wasn’t as innovative as the Sly of my dreams, it was nonetheless a solid, worthy, and all together fun romp with the old gang.",80
7428,378,2207,9,"It might have trouble holding a steady pace across the whole game, but Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is an enjoyable platformer with many differing styles of gameplay to keep things interesting.

It also boasts a ton of tricks to play with in terms of gameplay, despite its stealth nature slowly conceding territory to the more action-y aspects of its gameplay. In the end, the adventure is full of variety and fun, and may very well be the most refined and rich episode of the series - it most certainly is one of the best 3D platformers out there these days.",80
7433,230,2207,9,"This return is a success! Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time keeps doing what the former games of the series did very well : very colourful graphics, great direction and skilled platform levels. New characters, introduces by Sanzaru Games, are more a good idea than a bad one. And the lack of challenge is quickly forgotten because of a deep content and an hilarious adventure.",80

7441,262,2207,9,"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a more than decent platform. It's a bit too slow and it's been thought mainly for a really young audience. The basics are there, but everything else is an average mix which won't appeal to anyone.",77

7443,157,2207,9,"Still, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a very serviceable platformer that I really enjoyed my time with when it hit all of the right notes. Although it may not be the be all end all of mascot games in the HD-era, and the shining savior of the Sly Cooper franchise, platforming fans (and Cooper fans) should find plenty to enjoy in Sly and the gang’s latest adventure.",75
7444,220,2207,9,"Thieves in Time slyly manages to broaden the horizons of its traditional platform gameplay adding lots and lots of mini-games, which become proper missions featuring a high number of different game mechanics, all (too) easy to play with and enjoy. More quantity than quality, though.",75
7445,89,2207,9,"Sly Cooper Thieves in Time is a fun dive into an almost forgotten past, which barely survives a generation inflated by special effects and bullets. This is enough to recommend the production to all players who have grown up between bandicoot and dragons, for whom ""platform"" is also synonymous of ""color"" and ""sympathy.""",75
7446,228,2207,9,"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time's biggest upside is obviously the amount of variety. You'll never do the same thing for long, because before you know it, you're controlling another character in a new environment. Because of this, Sly is a platformer with a very high pace, but the lack of challenge will also make you go through faster than you might expect. It seems to focus more on a younger audience, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy this game as an adult.",75
7447,225,2207,9,Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a good game but not as good as it should and could have been. A repetitive mission structure and motion controls damper what is otherwise an enjoyable trip down memory lane for fans of the series.

7449,250,2207,9,"The whole experience feels like an anachronism. Younger gamers might accept some of these problems more readily, and when the game is on, it’s a lot of fun.

7450,395,2207,9,The only thing Thieves in Time does wrong is not try hard enough. Sanzaru didn't deviate enough from the PS2 plan and didn't take the time to create enough unique content. A lateral move from the previous entries in the series.,70

7588,450,186,4,"The chief problem with Battalion Wars is the AI, or more specifically the lack thereof. Units will do exactly what they are told, to a fault, oftentimes standing firm and getting peppered with enemy fire instead of moving to safer ground.",79

7616,285,1925,1,"This is an ensemble piece built purely for the ensemble and if you're happy to accept that there's no pretence of there being anything beyond that, you won't just enjoy Project X Zone, you'll love it.",80
7617,67,1925,1,"As much as I loved Project X Zone, it's not for everyone. The story is incomprehensible. It can be pretty repetitive. And those lacking a strong attachment to Capcom, Namco Bandai, and Sega's iconic characters might want to stay away. That said, this is a love letter from Japan that just any RPG fan should seriously consider checking out.",80
7618,262,1925,1,"Project X Zone is somewhat too long and enemies are more cannon food than real threats, however the sheer amount of fanservice and the immensely fun combat system make up for its flaws.",80
7619,334,1925,1,"Project X Zone excites through the use of OTT animations, crazy crossovers, and easily accessible action that will hook you time after time.",80
7620,365,1925,1,"Not the best choice if you're looking for a great SRPG on your Nintendo 3DS. Still, the best one if you're old enough to appreciate every dialogue and every character stuffed in this tiny cartdridge.",80
7621,430,1925,1,The gigantic clash of game worlds is a risky thing to do and that show in the storyline. The game offers a lot of action mixed with RPG-elements and keeps you busy for hours at a time.,80
7622,192,1925,1,"Project X Zone is a fun game that brings together characters from various Namco, Sega, and Capcom franchises. While it is a bit easy and not quite as deep as other tactical RPGs, like the Fire Emblem series, it’s not a bad game by any stretch. I just wish there was more to it.",80
7623,177,1925,1,"I didn't hate Project X Zone, but the overall package didn't provide the kind of thrills you'd expect from such an amazing roster of gaming giants.",79
7624,110,1925,1,"What Project X Zone lacks in expert strategies and rewarding tactics, it makes up for with a plethora of fun combat animations.",78
7625,41,1925,1,"Though simple, the game still gives you enough challenge to keep you playing.",78
7626,5,1925,1,Good clean turn based RPG fun with a celebrity cast that transcends franchises and genres.,78
7627,157,1925,1,"Provided that your a strategy RPG fan, if you’ve always wanted to see Mega Man X team up with Frank West and Jill Valentine, you’ll want to pick this game up for novelty alone.",75
7628,89,1925,1,Project X Zone is a product designed for super fans and lovers of Japanese genres.,75
7629,404,1925,1,"It's a very good title, but one that requires a lot of patience.",75
7630,361,1925,1,It's a credit to the strength of the iconic stature of the characters that seeing their bafflingly scripted journey to its end becomes an unavoidable errand.,70
7631,115,1925,1,"Despite the lack of depth and the repetition of combat, Project X Zone follows through as a tactical, humorous, preposterous romp through the best hits of video games. Even if you find the combat system strange, the streak of character cameos and the ridiculous number of hits that rack up with every battle will make any hardcore fan smile with appreciation. And if you're anything like me, that's hard to do.",70
7632,77,1925,1,"Project X Zone brings together more than 200 characters from various Namco Bandai, Capcom, and Sega properties—and then proceeds to have them engage in some of the most tedious, drawn-out battles in strategy-RPG history. Yes, it’s great fun in short bursts, but the game rarely lets you experience combat that way, unfortunately.",70
7633,255,1925,1,"An enjoyable self-homage with excellent 2D graphics and superb soundtrack, making a fun use of the dozens of historic characters from Sega, Capcom and Namco Bandai. However, it´s too long and repetitive, overstaying its welcome at some points.",70
7634,84,1925,1,"Project X Zone is a crazy japanese cocktail where characters from a huge number of popular games interact in funny ways. Its gameplay is interesting at the beginning but loses appeal after a few hours, the final experience anyway is good enough. If you love japanese games, just buy it and be happy.",70
7635,279,1925,1,"Project X Zone is a great game if you’re a fan of the Namco Bandai, Capcom, or Sega characters included in it.",70
7636,427,1925,1,"I desperately wanted to like Project X Zone. It does a lot of things right, even if it doesn't do them as well as other titles in the same genre. The translation is solid, the presentation is good, and the gameplay seems like it could be interesting. Alas, the game ends up being too tedious.",70
7637,171,1925,1,"Capcom, Namco and Sega deliver a new world record in pure fan service. Although the strategy parts and fighting could be better, this is still well worth your time and highly recommended for old school gamers.",70
7638,58,1925,1,"It is bound to have its critics then, but when you get to see Darkstalkers’ Morrigan fighting alongside Ghost and Goblin’s Arthur and a grandfather-clock, salt and pepper-shaker tossing Dynamite Cop, it’s almost impossible to stop yourself falling just a little bit in love with the whole affair.",70
7639,228,1925,1,"Project X Zone is a decent turn based strategy game, in which the recognizable characters obviously are the most it’s got going for it. That’s also its biggest issue: if you’re not familiar with games such as The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, then many parts of the game aren’t appealing to you anymore, or even not understandable at all. If you do know characters like Hsien-Ko, KOS-MOS and Kurt Irving, this point of critique doesn’t apply to you.",70

7641,210,1925,1,"Devoid of tactical depth and exhaustingly repetitive - yet somehow still entertaining and enjoyable, if taken in moderation. [Sept 2013, p.76]",70
7642,145,1925,1,"Project X Zone successfully delivers on the fan service and flashy battles, but it falls short in the strategy department. It’s a fun game to play in small intervals, but it’s a lengthy proposition clocking it at around 40-50 hours to complete.",69
7643,140,1925,1,"It's primarily the strength of its cast and its presentation, not the strength of its gameplay, that sustains you through the many long hours of this quest.",65
7644,160,1925,1,"Project X Zone forgot to put the 'tactical' and 'strategy' in tactical turn-based strategy. It lacks depth, which is a shame for a game that could've scored big. It also isn't challenging varied enough, but the great characters manage to alleviate some of those issues.",65
7645,70,1925,1,"Project X Zone had me excited when I saw the list of characters from 27 different franchises from Capcom, SEGA, and Namco Bandai and after I witnessed the epic trailers that surfaced before its release. Unfortunately, I wasn't as happy with the game as I'd hoped. With such a diverse cast of characters, personalities, and environments, it's a shame the gameplay feels so generic (both as a tactics RPG and as a miniature fighting game mimic).",62

7647,257,1925,1,"Not a particularly good game in its own right, but an enjoyably outrageous mash-up between three of Japanese gaming’s most prolific publishers.",60
7648,72,1925,1,"If the game's plentiful supply of scenarios offered more variety and the gameplay required a little more thought, Project X Zone could compete with the very best. As it stands, however, Project X Zone is overshadowed by superior alternatives.",60
7649,233,1925,1,"It embraces and relishes in the legacies and identities of the companies, characters, and worlds it encompasses. If you don't know or care about a lot of the cast, then this will do nothing for you. For others, engaging with characters from the unlocalized Valkyria Chronicles 3, or seeing Tron Bonne after the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3, will hold a unique significance. Project X Zone may be a poor strategy game, but it will still be a very special experience for many.",60
7650,82,1925,1,"Beneath the hysterical presentation, the frantic battle segments and the skittish storyline, then, Project X Zone is a thin game. The emphasis on fighting game reactions in the battle segments should appeal to genre fans, but these are too simplistic for genuine expression or mastery. Likewise, the tactical elements of positioning and unit movement on the battlefield lack urgency and true significance. The result is a humorous curio, perhaps, but one without the underlying game to adequately serve its stars.",60
7651,350,1925,1,"When Project X Zone arrived, I was eager and immediately threw it into my 3DS expecting a glorious time. When at last I finished it over seventy hours later, my stance had become a mixed bag.",60
7652,170,1925,1,"It certainly has its moments, particularly for those well-versed in gaming history, but ends up sabotaged by an insane lack of variety.",60
7653,451,1925,1,"It’s the videogame equivalent of a firework show: you’ll marvel at the pyrotechnics, but while your eyes and ears are in for a treat, there’s little here to engage your brain.",60
7654,87,1925,1,"Project X Zone reunites characters from Sega, Capcom and Namco in a tactical RPG that stands out for its simplicity and sense of humor.",60
7655,200,1925,1,"Unfortunately, while its combat is initially exciting, the enjoyment doesn’t hold up after multiple chapters of the same gameplay.",60
7656,86,1925,1,"It’s not easy to dislike Project X Zone, not only for its popular characters but also because it can be fun if played in small amounts, maybe a chapter a day.",60
7657,188,1925,1,"It’s certainly not an awful experience, but it feels very mindless and prolonged, not offering up enough depth to keep you engaged, which makes the experience suffer considering each battle can take upwards of 30 minutes to complete. It’s better consumed in smaller chunks, and I’d definitely suggest trying before you buy, whether you’re a big fan of the three publishers or not.",50
7658,132,1409,14,"A phenomenal addition to the Wii's library and will rival GoldenEye 64 in terms of the exhilarating multiplayer experiences that it offers up. Don't turn your nose up at it just because you don't like soccer or you'll be missing out on one of the best gaming experiences around. Now, bring on Super Smash Bros. Brawl!",100

7660,188,1409,14,Nintendo reminds us once again why they are the kings of multiplayer games with the release of Mario Strikers Charged. The non-stop and over-the-top insanity while playing with three friends simply must be experienced.,91

7662,320,1409,14,"Wii's first online title and also Wii's best multiplayer game. The action has a very polished feel to it, and there are plenty of different tactics and teams. The graphics and single player modes could have been better. [Aug 2007]",89

7665,19,1409,14,"All of the above adds up to a game that is fun, with enough depth to the action and strategy to keep Mario Strikers Charged in regular rotation, particularly when I need a game to cleanse the palette during and after the 4th Quarter.",85
7666,279,1409,14,"The game never allows a dull moment, and it will keep players engaged with its fast-paced antics.",85
7667,204,1409,14,"The gameplay, as I said above, is fast-paced. It actually feels a lot like old school NBA Jam in execution. [Sept 2007, p.68]",85

7670,136,1409,14,"As a single player game, it provides quite a bit of arcade action and the power ups make it a challenge and if you love to play online, this will keep you busy for quite some time.",83
7671,59,1409,14,"Overall, even though there are some minor AI issues, the enhanced graphics, Wii-remote specific control features and the addition of online multiplayer madness makes this title a worthy addition to any Wii owner's library of games.",82
7672,82,1409,14,"As the most original, admittedly surreal, take on the sport for years, Mario Strikers is a gem of a game and manages to flawlessly meet Nintendo's brief of appealing to absolutely everybody.",80
7673,31,1409,14,"A challenging single player game will last a while, but take it online for some real longevity.",80
7674,393,1409,14,"Fast, furious and most of all fun, Mario Strikers Charged is classic Nintendo territory, a game that appeals to even those who don't like the beautiful game that we affectionately call football.",80
7675,280,1409,14,Ultimately Mario Strikers: Charged is worth buying.,80
7676,123,1409,14,"Mario Strikers Charged features enough modes to keep players entertained, as well as a top-notch presentation that really shows off what the Wii can do.",80
7677,62,1409,14,"There are also too many Mega Strikes and tackles, but the game still provides a lot of fun.",80
7678,142,1409,14,"Not only does it adapt the gameplay mechanics of a GameCube title to the remote and Nunchuk, but it makes them pretty easy and accessible to use.",80
7679,155,1409,14,"That said, Strikers probably isn't the best sports game on the market, but it sure is a fun, arcade-like frolic through Mario's wild world – Strikers style.",80
7680,21,1409,14,"And that is where Charged really shines – the multiplayer arena. Take it online, knock some people around and have a blast.",80
7681,63,1409,14,"If you are a fan of Nintendo Sports titles of past years, then get to the present time and pick up a copy of this game, it's worth it.",80

7683,275,1409,14,"Short of game modes, reliant on powerups, sweatily frustrating at times. But it exerts a strange pull that will draw you back in, assuming you haven't smashed your remote. [July 2007, p.40]",78
7684,239,1409,14,"Mario Strikers Charged is a very fun multiplayer game that features some design choices that limit it, such as the primitive online mode. However, when it gets down to the core experience it offers, it’s undeniably fun.",77
7685,179,1409,14,"Better than the Gamecube version, and certainly the best online game on Wii. [July 2007, p.66]",75
7686,293,1409,14,Despite featuring only a short single player mode Mario Strikers Charged Football is an incredibly entertaining game and comes highly recommended for Wii owners who are starved for games.,75
7687,1,1409,14,"Charged seems like an amped-up, carnivalized reincarnation of Nintendo's own classic Ice Hockey.",75
7688,140,1409,14,"Mario's soccer sequel is a markedly more enjoyable game than its predecessor, especially for those who prefer the multiplayer arena.",75
7689,80,1409,14,"Mario Strikers Charged isn't a soccer game. It's a chaotic war of dispossession, body-checking, and garbage goals. [Sept 2007, p.80]",75
7690,107,1409,14,"Nintendo didn’t change much with Mario Strikers Charged, and they really didn’t have to. The transition to the Wii is a comfortable experience, and the online mode, though a bit clumsy, is a welcome addition.",75
7691,386,1409,14,"Gameplay is frantic, the presentation has been noticeably improved, and there's enough strategy for players to develop a style, which they can then show off online. All in all, it's a notable score for team Mario.",75
7692,145,1409,14,"An attractive game with a dark bent, and the pitches really bring the game to life.",74
7693,41,1409,14,The gameplay is classic Nintendo multiplayer fun and will put a smile on your face.,74
7694,110,1409,14,"The problem is – despite everything mentioned above – the game isn’t that fun. While Charged is an improvement over the original, it still piles on so much craziness that it buries itself with simplistic gameplay.",73
7695,50,1409,14,Shallow and frequently frustrating but the fast-paced gameplay makes for a fun multiplayer experience.,72
7696,413,1409,14,"If you approach the game with the mentality that Charged Football is going to be football in the Mario universe you'll find a game that is hard to get on with. If you accept that the emphasis is on flashy moves and fun over skill and precision, you'll find a game that has a place in your collection, even if it's only brought out every now and again.",70
7697,419,1409,14,"Mario Strikers Charged is far from a perfect game, but it truly is fun when played online. For the casual sports fan who doesn't want to spend hours poring over stats, defensive combinations, matchups, and what's inside the vending machines in their virtual team's arena, this game is very much worth a look.",70
7698,267,1409,14,"A very good game, terrific fun, ideal for the purpose, and just a big winner in multiplayer online or off. It is not going to set the world alight in single player, but we hope that Nintendo can see how favourably it has gone down with the online crowd and plan for the future accordingly.",70
7699,144,1409,14,The reason why it’s not fun at times isn’t because it doesn’t replicate the sport well--I would go so far as to say that I wish soccer had as much checking and all-out craziness--but rather that the AI becomes so incredibly cheap in the later tournaments and that there really isn’t much to the overall game aside from just beating the crap out of everyone to make way for a shot on goal.,70
7700,193,1409,14,"To sum things up, Mario Strikers Charged is a fun, yet brutal anti-soccer game for all ages, but unfortunately the graphics leave something to be desired.",70
7701,78,1409,14,"The eventful, minute-long matches and frantic to-and-fro make Mario Strikers a suitable curtain-raiser for online gaming on the Wii, but a balanced and deep extreme sports game this is not. [June 2007, p.87]",60

7721,255,2364,17,"As a sandbox game, State of Decay is not very impressive. But a survival game with an apocalyptic and zombies setting is pretty awesome. Combat, exploration and good community sense make for the most ambitious game for the XBLA in a long time.",80

State of Decay tries to show an emotional plot, but first of all it gives a lot more freedom, combat and exploration. The developers have ignored polishing the details and concentrated on building a convincing survival system (one that is more complicated than ""how many bullets have I got?"").

It has a great idea at its core, and I want to give the developers at Undead Labs credit for that. But lots of games begin with great ideas; executing those ideas well and letting the player experience them fully is the challenge. That’s where State of Decay falls apart.",70
7744,115,2364,17,"If you enjoy exploring post-apocalyptic open worlds, I suggest you at the very least give the demo of State of Decay a shot. There's plenty of depth for those who appreciate the role-playing genre, and the constant threat of death and limited resources will have adrenaline junkies on the edge of their seats.

7872,332,239,13,"This solid scrapper is let down by jagged edges around each character, vexing loading times and poor sound quality. [Christmas 2011, p.115]",70
7873,115,2754,17,"That said, with the plethora of other options ranging from churches to space programs, controlling an island nation bent on exorcizing its previous demons (existing under the Crown of an imperialist ruler) and taking sole command of an army and a civilization, Tropico 5 is a fulfilling experience.",80
7874,290,2754,17,"Like sipping a mojito while resting your panda-skin boots on a pauper, there's something nasty yet refreshing here, as it pushes you to maintain control in marvelously illiberal ways. [Feb 2015 (US), p.72]",70
7875,451,2754,17,"There's something infectious about Tropico 5's breezy attitude to tyranny and dictatorship. [Issue#156, p.118]",70
7876,195,2754,17,"This go around, Tropico 5 continues to have some annoying problems that need to be addressed. The controls are disappointing, the story mode is awful, and some other nagging issues persist.",65
7877,326,2754,10,"Finally, Tropico makes its debut on a PlayStation console and it's a great first appearance. Tropico 5 is a wonderful city builder, the mechanics of which are well-adapted to the PlayStation 4. Get this if you're a genre fan.",85
7878,207,2754,10,"Tropico 5 is a fun ""city builder"" for PS4, with great controls for a console strategy game, and lots of humor. Multiplayer is quite limited, though, and sometimes we miss some more onscreen information.",81
7879,328,2754,10,"From the campaign, to the sandbox, and even to the multiplayer, I’m eager to make sure that the Ivles McKittensby dynasty becomes a ruling force to reckon with in my quest to make and govern the perfect tropical island.",80
7880,74,2754,10,"Dialing the difficulty up also provides a real test of anyone's management abilities. So look past the satirical elements of Tropico 5. The humour is there, and it's funny, but the real strength of this series - especially with Sim City falling off the map completely in recent years - is that it plays so, so well.",80
7881,200,2754,10,A fun and surprisingly deep city-builder.,80
7882,430,2754,10,Tropico 5 on PS4 is just as fun as the PC version. The controls are surprisingly intuitive and the gameplay is addictive. Viva la revolucion!,80
7883,67,2754,10,"While Tropico 5 isn't the game-of-the-year masterpiece of a generation, it's a more-than serviceable sim and strategy title that can satisfy a grossly under-served genre within the console community.",80
7884,345,2754,10,"If you're even the slightest bit intrigued, you should give this a go. And just so that we're clear: that's an order.",80
7885,377,2754,10,"With great gameplay and a funky aesthetic, Tropico 5 manages to turn its dubious subject matter into something enjoyable. It's a pity that it doesn't quite sit comfortably on the PlayStation 4, but it's an engrossing experience nonetheless.",80
7886,332,2754,10,"Tropico 5 is like taking a holiday from standard strategy games: warm, amusing and, just like packing a mankini instead of your board shorts, revealing and stressful. [July 2015, p.96]",80
7887,35,2754,10,"This might be damning with faint praise, but considering the dearth of games in this genre, Tropico 5 is easily the best strategy game on the PS4 right now.",75
7888,228,2754,10,"Tropico 5 brings the most politically correct party to your living room. It is time consuming but fun to build up your own dictatorship. Tropico 5 is a great management game en many buildings really add something to your game. But, the controls are not optimized for PS4 that well, which makes micromanaging an awful thing to do.",75
7889,257,2754,10,"On the PC there are too few new features to satisfy existing fans, but on the PlayStation 4 the joys of being an island dictator still feel enjoyably fresh.",70
7890,422,2754,10,"With a lack of strategy and simulation titles on the platform, Tropico 5 is as alluring as ever, despite the fact that the series hasn't changed much over the years.",70
7891,329,2754,10,"Tropico 5 is a solid and gleefully wicked take on city building and strategy. The game’s modes and tone cleverly push you toward the path of power-mad nutbag at every step, but frequent restarts can feel like an insufferable drag.",70
7892,115,2754,10,"The bottom line is Tropico 5 is a good entry-level sim and strategy game. If you love SimCity and Civilization, this should be up your alley. Of course, you could just keep playing a board game, but I digress…",70
7893,242,2754,10,"Tropico 5 is a well-made strategy game filled with humor. The gameplay works ok with a controller instead of keyboard and mouse, although some menus are unnecessarily cumbersome. The genre's true peaks are still found on the PC, but Tropico is a good choice if you want to play a more laid back yet challenging strategy game on your TV.",70
7894,184,2754,7,"Tropico 5 cuts out the fat of previous entries and builds upon its strongest features. While the new dynasty system is disappointing, the narrative context provided by eras and world events is outstanding.",90
7895,208,2754,7,"It all blends into a winning mix that sees Tropico going from strength to strength delivering a fresh take on a concept that has captivated city-builder fans since the turn of the century. More than a decade after its inception, Tropico is still getting better and has me hooked all over again.",90
7896,39,2754,7,"Overall, this is probably the best game in the Tropico series, and one of the best city builders currently available.",90
7897,143,2754,7,"Tropico 5 isn't just the best of the series, but simply one of the best games of its kind. The Settlers and Anno series should take note.",88
7898,337,2754,7,"Solid, despotic fun. Tropico 5 isn’t revolutionary in any of its changes. But with deeper gameplay and some smart tweaks to the formula, it is deserving of at least another term in office.",85
7899,110,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is a polished sim game, the only downside being that city development begins to lose its luster because so many of the game modes feel so similar. But if you’re looking for an accessible, fun, and fresh city builder, Tropico 5 is an excellent choice.",85
7900,125,2754,7,"Even with these negatives, Tropico 5 is still a blast to play. The thrill of walking the line between the superpowers as you try to make your island (and yourself) as rich as possible hasn’t gone anywhere, and it’s still fun. It’s also nice that the internal strife never ends in Tropico.",85
7901,427,2754,7,"As a total package, it's a great starting point for new players. Gameplay mechanics like diplomacy have been simplified, so it's pretty easy to understand for newcomers.",85
7902,298,2754,7,"Being the best entry in the city-building strategy game series, Tropico 5 excites with a humorous campaign and a relaxed atmosphere, while the endless mode keeps motivated. Experienced players will miss a little depth and challenge, but its forgiving gameplay is especially attractive for newcomers.",83
7903,179,2754,7,"Light-hearted parody belies a deep simulation. Familiarity aside, oppressing the masses is rarely such fun. [Aug 2014, p.65]",82
7904,140,2754,7,"There is a lot to enjoy on the sandy beaches of Tropico 5. Whether you're playing alone or with up to three others online, the game strikes a good balance between style and substance that is easy to digest for all types of strategy fans.",80
7905,83,2754,7,"When the moment comes and you find the solution to a problem that's been bugging you all these hours, you can get awfully narcissistic and self congratulatory. You know, just like any old island dictator probably would.",80
7906,182,2754,7,"Dated graphics and a hopeless multiplayer section damage its overall appeal, but fans of the Tropico series and its competitors won’t be disappointed by the newest offering.",80
7907,146,2754,7,"Fives games in and the Tropico series has really found its feet, creating a cheery and relaxing ambience that sets it quite apart from other city-builders out there.",80
7908,430,2754,7,"Don't expect a revolution in the gameplay of Tropico 5, since it may feel like more of an expansion at times. However, it's a very impressive one at that. The new era system is absolutely wonderful and the management system is more complex than ever. This, and the inclusion of a new multiplayer mode should be more than enough to pull all of you dictators back to the wonderful island of Tropico.",80
7909,262,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is the best way to play a city simulator nowdays. If you have been disappointed by Sim City, this is the game to buy.",80
7910,378,2754,7,"A solid, accessible city builder, Tropico 5 gets out of the way and lets you have the fun you came for without pissing around in fiddly details.",80
7911,228,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is an incredibly fun strategy and management game, but this is mainly due to the core values that the series has always had. Developing your own tropical paradise and suppress your people in the most politically incorrect ways makes twisted fun and is challenging. The newly added eras definitely contribute something to the fun and challenge, but dynasty members, managers and the entire online mode can not count on our support. Tropico 5 is not a revolution; but what did you expect with a dictatorial game like this?",80
7912,181,2754,7,"A follow-up to the construction and management simulation game series brings the same gameplay and atmosphere that are flawless like in the previous installments, but on top of that it throws in several interesting novelties and improvements. The game could not avoid tiny flaws, but even with them it is an excellent experience.",80
7913,161,2754,7,"Do you want to ru(i)n an island? As supreme ruler on Tropico you can suppress your population, or see your country prosper. Every inhabitant is doing a job, thus it is far more practical if they work for you rather than against you. This small micro perspective combined with the macro management of foreign powers makes Tropico unique. Annoying features of past games in the series are gone. This should be a great game for old as well as new aspiring dictators.",80
7914,210,2754,7,"A better game overall than its predecessors, but not quite the revolution we were hoping for. [Issue#250, p.66]",80
7915,303,2754,7,"Haemimont's third Tropico game brings welcome changes while not diverging too much from the well worn path. [July 2014, p.60]",80
7916,255,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is a good title, almost essential if you are a regular to the series. It's perfect for those who want to enter this humorous environment for the first time.",80
7917,355,2754,7,"Tropico 5 has room for improvement, but even in its current state it brings sheer joy.",80
7918,34,2754,7,"Solid, engaging campaign is full of humor and shines especially during the Cold War era, but unfortunately fades in the modern period. [08/2014, p.75]",80
7919,296,2754,7,"Not a dramatic reinvention, but still an enjoyable game of construction, economics and election fraud.",78
7920,111,2754,7,"If you have played the other Tropico games, and if the similarities haven’t bothered you yet, then there isn’t any reason not to give Tropico 5 a whirl as well.",77
7921,37,2754,7,"Overall, Tropico 5 makes a solid entry into a genre already populated by great games. It has some drawbacks, but it gives you a good construction game while offering enough variety of play to offer many hours of fun games and great replay value.",75
7922,238,2754,7,The loopy dictator is only as loopy as the world that made him; his brand of insanity merely combats the surrounding insanity. Tropico is an open invitation to either revel in it or understand it.,75
7923,4,2754,7,For those who already own Tropico 4 maybe there aren't many reasons to buy this new iteration of the series.,75
7924,408,2754,7,"There’s little evolution in this edition, even though it still works and it’s really fun, so if you enjoyed the series before is a great option.",75
7925,220,2754,7,"Politically speaking, Tropico V is as conservative as they come: it seems committed to reforms, but in the end just supports the status quo.",73
7926,41,2754,7,"In technical respects Tropico 5 feels more like an expansion rather than a successor in the series. Many parts of the gameplay feel similar to past titles, but the inclusion of the era system, an overall campaign that is brimming with choices and consequences, as well as a plausible maiden attempt at multiplayer gives long time fans something new to try out.",72
7927,213,2754,7,"It will probably hold my interest far longer than Tropico 4 did. But at the same time, it's rough edges are a continual annoyance. The larger issue is that while Tropico 5 definitely introduces some new challenges and ideas, it's still a dangerously simple city-builder.",72
7928,359,2754,7,"The game definitely a lot going for it. Its new graphics and revitalize the look of the series, and some of the updated building make better use of the limited island space available. Additionally, the eras help take away the sense that Tropico is stuck in a time stasis bubble. Mid to late game empire management can get crazy, but that's nothing new. Still, it's hard to shake off the feeling that there's a lot missing, especially after putting in so many hours into the predecessor",70
7929,82,2754,7,"It works well for now, then, but Tropico 5 is clearly more concerned with introducing new concepts atop the old than it is with overhauling its base mechanics. Looking ahead to the future, this long-running series would benefit from having the fires of revolution lit beneath it.",70
7930,195,2754,7,"A stop-gap measure, another coat of paint on a series designed for a specific audience that’s looking for a specific experience. The freshly streamlined interface may court some new blood, but a lackluster campaign and a failure to branch out from the micromanagement-heavy core sim experience makes this a tough sell for outsiders to the genre.",70
7931,305,2754,7,"At number 5, we’re still seeing iteration rather than revolution. Everything that’s great about Tropico 5 is built on the same foundation that all the previous games have built on. That’s a solid foundation, of course, but it’s become a bit too familiar.",70
7932,148,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is a nice city builder. It is not as deep as fans would like, but is still enjoyable to play, fun and quite nice graphically.",70
7933,160,2754,7,"It is unfortunate that, with exception of the constitution and the present ages, the other innovations seem to bother Tropico 5. The dynasty mechanism is useless and is devoid of any personality. The multiplayer works when players work together peacefully, but falls apart once the game is approached as a competitive strategy game. Despite these setbacks, Tropico 5 does convince us. The core of the game was already strong and eras form a logical and organic progression in complexity. It is not the revolution that was promised, but Haemimont Games also get our vote of approval with part five of the series.",70
7934,24,2754,7,"Outside of the campaign, playing the sandbox mode, which also provides players with periodic goals ranging from export targets to constructing certain types of buildings, proves to be a more well-rounded experience - even if it lacks the amusing overarching story elements of the campaign.",70
7935,230,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is a good niche game, well into the series but without any revolution. The small evolutions are enough to justify the buy from a fan of the IP, but most gamers that want to discover a dictator's life will be better off with Tropico 4 which you can find with all DLC for less money. On the other hand, if you do want to try ruling the island with friends, there should be no hesitation: you need to get the last game of the Tropican dynasty.",65
7936,336,2754,7,"There's an undeniable tension between the player, in the role of The Dictator, and the citizens. Tropico 5 fails to reconcile that conflict in a mature way, missing its shot at changing the series from a thoughtless getaway to a memorable, meaningful trip.",65
7937,204,2754,7,Tropico 5 managed to disappoint more than it excited.,60
7938,451,2754,7,"While the great entries to the Sim City series, the Civilizations of the world, even Ubisoft’s Anno series and Galactic Civilizations II all give more back the more you put into it, Tropico 5 is unable to do that. And a lack of longevity in a game that should last so very long is just, ultimately, disappointing.",60
7939,233,2754,7,"It's passable and functional, but doesn't elevate the franchise or add the magic that'll bring El Presidente to a wider audience. It is what it is: Another evolution in a franchise that needs a revolution.",60
7940,106,2754,7,"The new Tropico can be recommended only to those who aren't familiar with the series. For everyone else (especially for fans of this tropical dictatorship) buying Tropico 5 will be a missed investment - the developers are offering the same bottle of rum with a different label. It's still the same good, old Tropico - without significant changes in gameplay, flawed merchant routes system, technical issues and the addition of a multiplayer mode.",60
7941,77,2754,7,"Tropico 5 is a noticeable, if subtle, revision on the Tropico formula. The new Eras and the Dynasty system create additional gameplay layers without disrupting the balance of the experience. The multiplayer, while fun when it works, mostly doesn’t.",60
7942,240,2754,7,"If the price was halved and the humour less forced, then the game would be worth it. This is just a rehash, albeit a good one.",60
7943,242,2754,7,"Dictator sim Tropico 5 offers a good strategy experience that is fairly easy to get into, compared with many of its competitors. The colorful graphics and music sets a nice tropical island tone and occasional laughs can be had due to the funny dialogue. However, compared with the best in the genre, Tropico 5 feels a bit monotonous at times, in particular towards the end of a round.",60
7944,403,1232,15,Don't let Rainbow Curse's relatively small length put you off; it's a sublime experience that completely washes its hands of the padding most games employ to justify a retail release.,100
7945,280,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a beautiful, creative, and fun-loving game that absolutely deserves your time and attention.",100
7946,188,1232,15,"All in all, I can’t deny that Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a great game.",91
7947,67,1232,15,"It's a game that has a little something for everyone, all without compromising its unyielding, unique, and undivided attention on its mission to blast pure adorableness into the world in all directions. If Kirby and the Rainbow Curse doesn't make you smile, you may need to see a doctor for that.",90
7948,77,1232,15,"Bright, colorful worlds brought to life by a unique art style, coupled with challenging, diverse gameplay highlights yet another successful Kirby spin-off that is as good or better in many ways than its predecessor.",90
7949,204,1232,15,"Much like Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a constantly creative adventure that offers players something they won’t find anywhere else.",90
7950,448,1232,15,Kirby offers a fantastic experience for the amount of content it provides and the price.,90
7951,404,1232,15,"Singular gameplay, original art style, very well designed levels, amiibo, multiplayer, memorable soundtrack and a huge number of collectables. Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a must.",90
7952,55,1232,15,"Guiding Kirby around each world in Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush is a true delight thanks to fluid controls, innovative gameplay and magnificent audio and visual presentation.",90
7953,185,1232,15,Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is another good reason to have a Wii U in your living room. The small world of clay created by Hal Laboratory is wonderful to explore and fun to play.,86
7954,336,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse shines because it’s a simple game that delivers superbly on a simple concept. You’re repeating many of the same actions again and again, but with each new stroke it feels more refined, more graceful.",85
7955,382,1232,15,"Minor annoyances aside, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse continue’s Kirby’s hot streak of lovable, imaginative, joyful adventures. As shrewd as it is straightforward, HAL’s latest effort provides an afternoon of unassuming fun for a fair price, and no matter how much I try, I just can’t ever over how damn wondrous it looks!",85
7956,200,1232,15,"Massively cute it may be, but this is a Kirby title that packs substance to go along with its drop dead gorgeous style.",85
7957,274,1232,15,"On the whole, Rainbow Curse is an inventive, charming game that does a wonderful job of living up to the legacy of Canvas Curse. [Issue #14: Old vs. New – March/April 2015, p.73]",85
7958,268,1232,15,"Cuddly cute, surprisingly, outrageously fun and best of all ­ minimally flawed.",85
7959,182,1232,15,"Basically, if you were a fan of Canvas Curse, there’s no reason to think you won’t enjoy this sequel. A little bit of the uniqueness is gone, but this is still a fun twist on the traditional sidescroller.",82
7960,184,1232,15,"With a handmade look, and a different approach to platforming, Rainbow Curse is one of Kirby’s strongest spin-offs, and one of the best uses of the Gamepad to date.",80
7961,359,1232,15,"By its very nature, it feels more at home on a handheld. Just in this case, it's a handheld system that's tethered to your living room console.",80
7962,213,1232,15,"A delightfully charming and unique platformer. Its world is varied, its challenge is high, and the hand-molded look and feel make for a remarkable journey.",80
7963,273,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse isn’t going to be a game that is mentioned in Game of the Year conversations at the end of the year, but it is a great way to kill some time in a beautifully created world.",80
7964,41,1232,15,"Kirby fans will be delighted by this series entry, especially if they remember Canvas Curse with fondness. Other gamers should definitely give this one a try. It has that good ol' Nintendo quality and sense of playfulness in spades.",80
7965,243,1232,15,"A visually stunning game with clever and varied design, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a very welcome addition to the Wii U library, even if its simplistic premise and mechanics eventually get tiresome.",80
7966,279,1232,15,"In the end, Rainbow Curse is a good game that provides plenty of content for both single players and a group of friends.",80
7967,22,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is charming, cute and fun. It takes great advantage of the GamePad’s capabilities and proves to be one the best spin-offs in the Kirby series.",80
7968,35,1232,15,A genuine visual marvel and one of the most beautiful technical achievements on the Wii U.,80
7969,361,1232,15,"After the last few willfully easy Kirby games, it's a nice change to see the poor little puffball repeatedly die as you struggle for mastery.",80
7970,64,1232,15,"It’s cute, charming, and lots of fun, with enough challenge to stand up on its own right among other platformers.",80
7971,192,1232,15,"An excellent debut for Kirby on the Wii U, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is amazing to see in motion. Too bad players won't get to do much of that, as spectators get the best seats for this show.",80
7972,85,1232,15,"Colorful, fun and addictive - new Kirby title offers not only a captivating visual setting, but also a great gameplay.",80
7973,78,1232,15,"It's a real treat to examine the craftsmanship of the models in close-up, while the soundtrack is one of Kirby's best to date. [May 2015, p.120]",80
7974,4,1232,15,This is an excellent debut for Kirby on the Wii U. Imaginative and joyful adventures for the Nintendo's console.,80
7975,179,1232,15,"Another case of Ninty spinning endless invention from the simplest of ideas. Well worth a play(doh). [June 2015, p.72]",80
7976,129,1232,15,"In classic Nintendo Style, what we have here is a beautiful game filled with addictive challenges, great gameplay and ideal co-op mode.",80
7977,220,1232,15,"When it focuses on the classic platform elements, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse shines brightly. It's a pity it often tries to change itself into something less exciting.",79
7978,110,1232,15,"I never fully fell in love with only having secondary control of Kirby. Drawing platform lines is undeniably different, but I’m not convinced it’s the best way to play a platformer. Rainbow Curse smartly toys with the mechanic, adding surprising twists and changes, and by the end I was having a good time – even if I still was yelling at Kirby to just do what I told him every now and then.",78
7979,207,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a platform game that runs away from standards to offer some very interesting mechanics, but, at the same time, it feels strange, like a portable game stuck in the pad of a home console.",78
7980,54,1232,15,"With memorable, meaningful levels that cleverly utilise the game’s simple dynamic with aplomb, it’s wonderful, joyous stuff; cute, clever and charming. And unlike other Kirby games, it’s actually challenging.",77
7981,5,1232,15,"The concept is not as fascinating as it was ten years ago, but nonetheless Kirby still is a source of creativity. The clay’ish artdesign is as cute and cuddly as its star. The inclusion of the precise touchscreen controls is a perfect example for the capabilities of Wii U. Unfortunately Kirby’s excursion is rather short.",77
7982,221,1232,15,"This new Kirby makes us fall in love with his new graphics and it's funny to play, totally focused on the Wii U Gamepad, but it loses steam at the middle and runs out of freshness.",77
7983,255,1232,15,"Funny, adorable, visually breathtaking, this new Kirby maybe comes with an element most of the fans will not like it, like the idea of moving it through scenarios using a paintbrush and no jumping or something. But, although the control system is not the best, certainly the levels are so well designed, the collectibles numerous and the graphics and soundtrack so good, that it deserves at least one try. One of those 100% Nintendo Games that only want you to have fun and smile. And Paintbrush got it.",76
7984,145,1232,15,"It may not be Kirby’s most triumphant outing, but Rainbow Curse is still an entertaining ride.",75
7985,230,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is one of the most refreshing games since the Wii U has launched. It's hard to not get frustrated though by the lack of gamble from a gameplay point of view, by a certain lack of pace. And last but not least, it's a shame we have to look so much at the GamePad screen.",75
7986,277,1232,15,"Charming the game may be, Rainbow Curse is a few strokes from greatness: overly repetitive mechanics, underused ideas, and a failure to integrate its clay theme into gameplay in any meaningful way keep it from reaching the lofty heights to which it potentially could. Well crafted, but not a masterpiece.",70
7987,73,1232,15,"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a weird and beautiful game, but it's an odd fit for the Wii U.",70

7989,430,1232,15,This Kirby game looks amazing and for kids it is fun to give them the feeling that they can paint and play at the same time. However it's annoying to use the stylus through he whole game. So therefore it's a bit disappointing.,70
7990,160,1232,15,"Secretly we would have liked a more conventional Kirby platformer, although this one definitely is entertaining. The controls are not precise enough to draw good lines for Kirby, but the game makes us feel upbeat and there is lots to explore (single-player and co-op).",70

8123,4,1110,12,Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational is a very enjoyable game. One of the best launch titles for Sony's portable device.,81
8124,83,1110,12,Even if Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational doesn't necessarily feel completely new – this is a big fistful of uncomplicated yet highly engrossing golfing fun that is hard not to recommend. It's not as much of a showcase title as other games in the Vita's Launch-Line-Up but that is due to the fact that it focuses on long found strengths rather than trying desperately trying to come up with new ones for this particular new piece of hardware.,80
8125,202,1110,12,"Everybody's Golf doesn't do anything particularly new or revolutionary, but it does what it does very well indeed.",80
8126,310,1110,12,"And again we find ourselves playing a Vita game without a necessary online component, in this case the option for one on one duels. Other than that, a lack of proper innovation is the only drawback. You won't regret buying this addictive, accessible and very content-packed handheld title.",80
8127,72,1110,12,"The game does what the series has excelled at since day one, provide an accessible golfing experience that anyone can enjoy. Unlike some of the other titles in the Sony platform's library, this one doesn't rely on gimmicks. Its focus is solid gameplay, depth and charm, and it has these things down to a tee.",80
8128,145,1110,12,"World Invitational may not possess the sheer system-selling appeal of an Uncharted: Golden Abyss, but it's still a solid, packed launch game that old hands as well as rookies should consider grabbing alongside their Vitas.",80
8129,115,1110,12,"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise-Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational will satisfy every fan of the golf genre and as polished as its console counterpart. The criticism that it's not as simple as its cheerful graphics is misguided, as anyone with good timing and planning can shoot up the scoreboard with ease. With a robust multiplayer, plenty of unlockable, and many hours of replay value, World Invitational is a clean, well-centered shot for the PlayStation Vita.",80
8130,451,1110,12,"Delivers a quality experience on par with, if not better than previous iterations. [Issue#119, p.98]",80
8131,262,1110,12,Everybody's Golf is another addictive installment in the lucky franchise and one of the best launch games for PlayStation Vita. It packs a lot of content in single and multiplayer modes; however it doesn't fully support most of Vita's hardware features and it shows a somewhat lack of creativity with its recycled playfields and visuals.,80
8132,242,1110,12,"Everybody's Golf makes its appearance on the Vita and not much has changed from the previous games. It may have some minor flaws, but it's a great launch game for the Vita.",80
8133,331,1110,12,"This sucker devours bus and train trips. [March 2012, p64]",80
8134,148,1110,12,"Hot Shots Vita remains a nobrainer for Sony consoles. This tru sim-game wrapped in its cute graphics is easy to pickup, but hard to master. With its online play, loads of stuff to unlock, and precise gameplay, its as good as ever, even though we'd have hoped for more new features and better visuals.",80
8135,448,1110,12,"I am addicted to Hot Shots Golf World Invitational. It still has a lot of collectibles, a good challenge and, overall, a fun experience. The only things that irked me are minor problems that can be overlooked, but also can be frustrating to deal with at the same time.",80
8136,34,1110,12,"The game's biggest problem is that it doesn't offer anything fresh – it's roughly Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds from PS3 (which is still impressive for a handheld). [March 2012, p.77]",75
8137,140,1110,12,Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational proves that more of the same can still be really fun.,75
8138,89,1110,12,Everybody's golf for PS Vita is exactly how we expected it to be: another increbily funny iteration in the saga.,75
8139,110,1110,12,"Being predictably solid is both a blessing and curse for the Hot Shots series, and at the end of the day I try to not overthink the fact that World Invitational is simply a fun experience. I approach it a lot like my real-life golf game, where I just try to enjoy being out in the sunshine and not get too wound up at the numbers on the score card.",75
8140,182,1110,12,"Developer Clap Hanz has produced a thoroughly enjoyable and addictive game, filled with a simplicity that makes it accessible for players of all abilities.",75
8141,250,1110,12,"If you enjoy a game with simple pick-up-and-go golfing mechanics, don't mind a hefty challenge from time to time, and love to customize your characters from head to toe, then Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational is worth picking up for your PlayStation Vita.",75
8142,151,1110,12,"Look past certain design flaws - and certain mechanical issues – however, and you'll find a highly enjoyable, highly addictive golf game that's accessible to all types of player, from the kid in the back seat during a car ride to the most dedicated gamer.",75
8143,225,1110,12,The best aspect of Everybody's Golf for the PS Vita is that you can pick up the console and play the game anytime and anywhere without too much thought. The gameplay is pretty much flawless and some of the PS Vita controls are actually quite fun. It's also quite an addictive title that makes this such a hard game to put down as you're always striving for that perfect score. Add in online multiplayer and you'll be playing Everybody's Golf on the PS Vita for a considerable amount of time.,75
8144,5,1110,12,"Everybody's Golf always was and still is a challenging, very charming delight with a lot of content. But on Vita it lacks new ideas while the physics system doesn't seem to be up to date.",72
8145,286,1110,12,"Everybody's Golf is the premier example of a pick-up-and-play game perfectly suited for a handheld console. Despite its initial appeal we got bored pretty quickly due to a lack of variation and innovation over the previous installments. [March 2012, p.54]",72
8146,184,1110,12,"It gets by just fine with its tried-and-true, user-friendly golfing action, strong multiplayer, and a mostly smart smattering of Vita-specific gimmicks and upgrades.",70
8147,78,1110,12,"Unadventurous Everybody's Golf may be, but it's wonderfully executed, and its presence at Vita's launch is welcome. With their endlessly smiling characters, cheery J-tunes and bright skies, Everybody's Golf titles are the best Nintendo-esque games a Sony console has ever seen, and this latest iteration is no exception.",70
8148,387,1110,12,This latest iteration doesn't change much - it doesn't have to - but it does have a few tricks up its argyle-patterned sleeve.,70
8149,257,1110,12,"It may not offer any surprises, but with a mountain of modes, options and unlockables this amiable golf sim is another excellent showcase for the PS Vita.",70
8150,82,1110,12,"It's one of the strongest launch titles, offering taut fun and challenge in a rapid-fire, quick-load manner that's perfectly suited to the handheld. It may not offer a vision of the portable future that Sony's creative dreamers were hoping for, but as a video game, it works small wonders.",70
8151,171,1110,12,Lots of unlockables and enough fun make Everybody's Golf Vita a charming little golf game.,70
8152,259,1110,12,"The deep single player component, in-game shop and multiplayer will keep you putting for weeks, and with the possibility of downloadable content, perhaps even longer. Not the most casual golf title on the market, but all things considered, definitely one of the best you'll find on a handheld.",70
8153,84,1110,12,"A very good more of the same chapter in the Everybody's Golf series, but still... too much ""more of the same"". True fans will love it!",70
8154,226,1110,12,"There's not enough depth to justify long play sessions, but long sessions are not really the point here. What Everybody's Golf does is provide a great escape in short bursts and it packs just enough in to keep you coming back to it time and again.",70
8155,413,1110,12,"It gets the basics right and backs up its tight gameplay mechanics with tidy visuals and portable-friendly loading times - something that a few of the higher profile launch games can't claim. The dev team certainly played it safe, but going for PAR isn't a bad thing.",70
8156,86,1110,12,"Everybody's Golf 6 doesn't do anything new, it is basically the same experience of home consoles but on a handheld.",70
8157,332,1110,12,"The difficulty curve is satisfying. [March 2012, p.115]",70
8158,170,1110,12,"Basicly the same game as previous releases, but that will certainly be enough for most players. It was for us.",70
8159,129,1110,12,"It's easy to learn, hard to master, addictive and beautiful. Simply put, it's one of the best buys a PSVita owner could make.",70
8160,148,273,7,Botanicula is a wonderful tale in which one loves getting lost; a real puzzler to have fun with; and a genuine visual and sound art piece.,100
8161,10,273,7,"It's funny, clever and totally lovable.",93
8162,106,273,7,"Botanicula is yet another game for people looking for some unusual aesthetic emotions. Upon launching Animata Design's game you can be sure you're embarking on a short, but exceptional journey that makes ordinary adventure games seem sad and bleak.",90
8163,13,273,7,"A creation of obvious love and care, Botanicula is a must-play for those seeking a truly imaginative and entertaining adventure game",90
8164,255,273,7,"Just like when we were kids, Botanicula takes a tiny, simple element and creates an astonishing world of sounds and visuals so captivating, haunting, dazzling and spectacular that makes this last masterpiece of Amanita Desing a playable jewel full of smiles, laughs and tenderizing moments. Undoubtely, one of the most precious games of the year. And one of the funniest graphic adventures too!",90
8165,181,273,7,Botanicula continues in the point-and-click entertainment that's been typical of Amanita Design studio. This game brings an imaginative mix of visual story-telling and rebuses making it extremely engaging and entertaining fun for everyone.,90
8166,213,273,7,"Titles like Botanicula are why the point-and-click adventure genre continues to exist. It may not be as hilarious as adventure games of yesteryear, but it's persistently delightful, oozing character and grabbing hold of the imagination.",90
8167,408,273,7,"A wonderful experience that will please us, blending nature and videogames, creating a beautiful and captivating atmosphere that we want to see in more games.",90
8168,240,273,7,Cute and very catchy exploratory adventure created with passion scores thanks to the brilliant idea and the authentic approach of the game design. [May 2012],90
8169,24,273,7,"Interacting with this bright and soulful world is a deeply involving experience, and you'll find yourself continually finding excuses to play for just a few more minutes.",90
8170,140,273,7,To play Botanicula is to peer through a microscope at hidden world and feel like you've made the greatest of discoveries: one of a place that's so overflowing with imagination and so full of wonder that only a person with a heart of stone would fail to be taken in by its charms.,85
8171,262,273,7,"Botanicula is an explosion of joy. A breathing world dotted with fantasy creatures, hilarious situations and enemies no scarier than a puppet box.",85
8172,4,273,7,"Botanicula is an exceptional journey across a tree in danger with fantastic characters, hilarious situations and imaginative challenges.",85
8173,230,273,7,"Following their great Machinarium, more narrative and a little more difficult than their previous productions, Amanita Design come again toward an adventure without any words. A simple travel among beautiful landscapes and humorous situations.",85
8174,146,273,7,"If you can pull yourself away from killing things for a few hours to play a sweet, adorable, bizarre, funny, joyful game, you owe it to yourself to buy Botanicula. It's not massively challenging and it only really lasts four hours, but you'll have a smile on your face for the entire time – and often a good laugh too.",85
8175,89,273,7,Botanicula stands as an extraordinary example of what creativity can do. Everyone should admire the incredible shine of this little gem.,85
8176,365,273,7,"Botanicula is a great point and click adventure made by Amanita Design. The game is fascinating, rich with ironic sequences and beautiful locations, with five protagonists with different skills.",85
8177,110,273,7,"By its nature as an exploration-focused adventure game, Botanicula has a deliberate pace, and the lack of direct control over character actions might irk some players. Old-school adventure gamers are in for a treat, and should absolutely put this on the playlist. In fact, if those same gamers are ready to pass their enthusiasm on to the next generation, Botanicula seems tailor-made to be enjoyed by a parent and child.",83
8178,320,273,7,"Botanicula looks and sounds amazing, just looking at it makes you happy! That said, it could have benefited from better puzzle design and the story delves a bit too deep into absurd and vague territory. Thankfully, the good outweighs the bad and Botanicula ends up being an enjoyable adventure. [May 2012]",83
8179,5,273,7,"As an adventure it is not challenging, the puzzle solutions are too obvious - at least once you know where your hero squad is supposed to go. But nonetheless this is a heartwarming declaration of love towards colorful zest for life.",82
8180,296,273,7,"A different kind of adventure, in a very different kind of world that wastes no time before growing on you.",82
8181,413,273,7,"Utterly lovely, although certainly imperfect, Botanicula is a game filled with soul and bursting with imagination.",80
8182,83,273,7,"Animated movie, point and click adventure and puzzle game meet halfway. Adorable, odd and as much a breath of fresh air as only a game about trees and those who live on them could be.",80
8183,67,273,7,"There's very little fluff or padding and while the game is not always focussed on guiding you down a certain path, it's hard to get sidetracked and lose what your goal is.",80
8184,87,273,7,It's difficult to explain with words what makes a game so great that actually doesn't use them at all.,80
8185,84,273,7,"Botanicula is a vivid ""peace giver"" in a such a chaotic world, a beautiful fresco in the videogame universe.",80
8186,160,273,7,"Botanicula is one big orchestra, and the mouse cursor is the choirmaster. It's sometimes too much of a puzzle game, sometimes too little, but always a treat to listen to and observe.",80
8187,34,273,7,"Amanita Design are still in great shape. If you liked Machinarium, you must play Botanicula! [June 2012, p.90]",80
8188,129,273,7,"A wondrous surrealistic adventure on and through the living branches of a ""magical"" tree, Botanicula is a beautiful addition to Amanita's game roster.",80
8189,7,273,7,"A simple, yet very endearing game. If Botanicula were a living creature, you'd want to hold it in your arms and pet it around the neck. What a cutie! If only it were a wee bit smarter.",80
8190,303,273,7,"Invites you into a beautifully realised, wholly consistent and ever-so-slightly alien ecosystem and keeps you wondering what you'll see next. [June 2012, p.63]",80
8191,302,273,7,"Botanicula can't hide its shortcomings, mostly the short duration (about three hours for completion), the non-existent replay value and the tiresome transitions between riddles in the hub. However, its magic atmosphere, the surrealistic portrayal of nature and the happy disposition that sips through from this strange world, compile a unique title, true to the standards of its Czech developers. [July 2012]",78
8192,348,273,7,"All-in-all, Botanicula is a competent adventure game. What it lacks in story and characters, it does its best to make up for in scenery and puzzle variety. It may be rather short, but it's still an enjoyable experience I recommend to adventure gamers looking for something a little different. If point and click adventures are not usually your thing, or you're only interested in this because of your experience with Machinarium, then I'd definitely advise you to at least wait for a Steam sale.",71
8193,78,273,7,"Though it occasionally goes pear-shaped as an adventure game due to the stinginess of its feedback, Botanicula is never less than a breath of fresh air.",70
8194,82,273,7,"Another one of those weird little offerings that is as much a place as it is a game: an old tree filled with strange life, in which dazzling secrets lurk under every stone. Click!",70
8195,257,273,7,"Charming, clever and attractive; Botanicula is the perfect antidote to angst-ridden gaming and a fine graphic adventure in its own right.",70
8196,389,273,7,"It is all so persistently delightful to experience, so charmingly quirky that Botanicula has the power to melt away any frustrations resulting from the occasionally poor section of gameplay.",70
8197,242,273,7,"Solve puzzles in a bizarre colorful environment, using different characters with different abilities. But the puzzles are too easy and too illogical for this game to be much more than mediocre.",60
8198,271,405,7,"This game will give any gamer a headache, but in the good way; the way that will keep you coming back for more, so stock up on Advil.",90
8199,108,405,7,A fun and highly challenging tactical game that will test your analytical skills as well as your undying patience.,90
8200,158,405,7,"Again, they&#146;ve offered us even more action and variety than before, but still kept that chess-like gameplay for which the original Commandos game was famous.",90
8201,147,405,7,"A must have for anyone who appreciates the art of tactical strategy. The general package left a taste of blood in my mouth, and I couldn&#146;t be more satisfied.",89
8202,213,405,7,"While no other franchise can present you with so many seemingly insurmountable challenges, no other franchise is able to offer such a feeling of accomplishment once the objectives are miraculously achieved.",89
8203,10,405,7,"Visually, the Commandos universe seems more atmospheric and immersive than ever before, and the addition of multiplayer increases the game's replay value.",85
8204,132,405,7,"Despite these shortcomings, Destination Berlin&#146;s blend of battlefield strategy and sneaky infiltration will appeal to experienced strategy fans. Novices should scout out another battle.",80
8205,294,405,7,But what makes Commandos 3 : Destination Berlin more than just a good strategy game is how it somehow allows you to again believe&#151;however much tongue-firmly-in-cheek&#151;in that comic book WWII mythical world.,80
8206,82,405,7,"Make no mistake that it is going to give you absolute hell, yet beyond the initial frustration at your apparent gaming impotence, attempting to penetrate its steely exterior becomes a bizarre pleasure that offers a triumphant sense of achievement.",80
8207,140,405,7,The game's high level of challenge can lead to some proportionally satisfying victories against all odds.,79
8208,111,405,7,"Could it possibly be more impressive than Commandos 2? The answer is no, and I don&#146;t think developer Pyro Studios even really tried.",78
8209,296,405,7,"Those 12 missions might not sound like a lot, but their sprawling scope and elaborate challenges will keep you busy for dozens of hours. [Holiday 2003, p.118]",78
8210,162,405,7,"While Commandos 3 is still a strong concept, and most definitely a super-looking game, it's only suitable for the most patient veterans of the series.",77
8211,295,405,7,"One of the most rewarding games around for the devout strategist, but those less experienced will find it hard to get started, and may get disheartened by the obstacles.",77
8212,142,405,7,"The movement and timing puzzles that make up the bulk of the gameplay can be tedious and frustrating, but completion of a mission always brings a rewarding sense of accomplishment.",75
8213,446,405,7,"Without patience and some dedication, this could be a quick ticket to frustration. But that's also what makes the game appealing, because for those who are up to it, there's a serious challenge in store.",70
8214,451,405,7,"Sadly, despite such impressive scope, the difficulty level takes its toll on the playing experience. Only those with buckets of patience and strategic acumen will ever fully realise this game's awesome potential. [Dec 2003, p.110]",70
8215,300,405,7,"With varied missions, nice visuals, and an awesome musical score Commandos 3 is a game you very much want to enjoy, but in the end there are too many issues to keep you from fully feeling satisfied.",68
8216,115,405,7,"A quality experience for the hardcore strategy gamer. The biggest drawback is that it&#146;s so similar to the older Commandos; frankly, you may have already experienced this battle before.",67
8217,78,405,7,Ignorance of Pyro's past glories is actually an advantage with Commandos 3 since it means the tension and atmosphere that the series still has in abundance can be enjoyed without the nagging feeling that things aren't what they used to be. Inspiration and aspirations appear to be in short supply in the Commandos camp.,60
8218,110,405,7,"It just doesn't do anything to make the gameplay more accessible or enjoyable to the general gaming public. [Jan 2004, p.157]",60
8219,105,405,7,"But this game is too difficult. Hell, we got frustrated by the tutorial. Not a good sign. By far the biggest problem is that you'll be fighting the camera controls as much as the Nazis.",50
8220,49,405,7,"A big step backward for the Commandos franchise. While the game would like to evoke ""Saving Private Ryan"" and other WWII films, sadly the movie that actually comes to mind while playing is ""Groundhog Day,"" only with Nazis and a Quick Load button.",40
8221,47,405,7,"Pure blah from the opening missions in snowy Stalingrad to the last hurrah on the beaches of Normandy. [Jan 2004, p.67]",30
8222,279,1400,4,"The game is very challenging, and trying to collect all of the mini-games is rewarding. I will be playing this one even on my Revolution next year.",85
8223,132,1400,4,"For those of you who party religously, you won't be disappointed. [Jan 2006, p.80]",80
8224,142,1400,4,"It's better than the last game but not all that innovative. Of course, until somebody else steps up and makes a great party game, Mario Party's the only gig in town.",80
8225,278,1400,4,"Adds some nice new features to the tried-and-true formula. [Jan 2006, p.110]",75
8226,239,1400,4,"Mario Party 7 offers much love to everyone that will take it. The mic is accurate and responsive, no complaints there, though it would have been nice to have a few more mini-games that actually involved it.",75
8227,450,1400,4,This is yet another sequel for the fans of the series that don't want anything more than a comfortable dip in the same old pool.,74
8228,63,1400,4,"The seventh iteration crams even more mini-games than you care to count, but sadly shies away from offering something truly innovative for loyal Mario fans.",70
8229,213,1400,4,"To its credit, the title delivers some fun new boards and mini-games, and the multiplayer experience is as robust and enjoyable as ever. But it in contrast dishes out a worthless single-player mode marred by tediously slow computer-controlled character interactions.",70
8230,446,1400,4,"For new players or rabid fanatics, Mario Party 7 is a respectable addition to the series. But for anyone expecting to have a great time with less than four people, this release can kill the party instead of starting it.",70
8231,30,1400,4,"Probably is the best game overall in the franchise to date, however it simply doesn't do enough new to warrant a definitive purchase.",69
8232,263,1400,4,"Unless there is a vested interest in this game, it is not really worth getting.",68
8233,189,1400,4,"Looks, feels, and plays exactly like every other Mario Party ever made. The new 8-player games, new boards, and new minigames aren't enough to differentiate it from anything else you've seen served up by the pudgy plumber and friends.",67
8234,140,1400,4,"It's not dramatically different from Mario Party 6 or, frankly, any of the other Mario Party games, but as a cheery collection of simple pick-up-and-play minigames that's well suited for younger and more-casual players, it still works.",65
8235,320,1400,4,"Takes you back to the world of minigames. It seems like the best ideas are already used, though. Only the mic games are slightly refreshing. [Jan 2006]",65
8236,9,1400,4,"Mario Party 7 probably is the best game overall in the franchise to date; however, even with that being the case it simply doesn't do enough new to warrant a definitive purchase.",60
8237,264,1400,4,"Basically Mario Party 6, but with less fun and [fewer] new ideas.",60
8238,80,1400,4,"The minigames are simply too short - newbies might find a game ending just when they've gotten the hang of it. [Jan 2006, p.125]",60
8239,41,1400,4,The storyline is so lame that the game would have been better off without it.,60
8240,66,1400,4,"Doesn't offer up anything different here, with the exception of some new minigames and a freshly themed game board.",60
8241,99,1400,4,And what's with all the text? One thing that continually aggravated our group of casual gamer test subjects (relatives we roped into playing) was the inordinate amount of text you need to wade through while you're playing.,60
8242,180,1400,4,For the eighth installment we recommend a speed play option; until then the party will have to get along without us.,50
8243,110,1400,4,"There are plenty of better ways to do a bunch of crap with your friends that isn't ay fun and doesn't make any sense, like hiding batteries in people's shoes. [Dec 2005, p.178]",50
8244,164,1400,4,"This latest Party shows too many similarities to last year's part six, and not nearly enough improvements. Fans can dig in, but the rest of us need a livelier Party.",50
8245,1,1400,4,"The problem with Mario Party is this: the downtime is completely ridiculous. In a game where the sole purpose is to entertain you in a party-like environment, sitting out for periods of up to 10 minutes at a time, waiting for everyone to roll the dice, run around, shop for items, use said items, compete in stale, single-player mini-games, pointless microphone games and other random events drives one to tears of boredom.",40
8246,82,1400,4,"It's such a shame that Nintendo - the creator of Mario Kart, which is arguably the most fun you can have with platonic friends - just can't seem to sort Mario Party's problems out, even for the seventh instalment in the series. Roll on number eight, eh.",30
8247,280,210,14,"It provides an original story with polished visuals and audio, brings in lots of favorite heroes and villains, and has much variety in both gameplay and level design.",77
8248,279,210,14,"Fans of the Ben 10 television show will probably get the most out of this game, but those seeking more in-depth platforming action should probably look elsewhere. While certainly enjoyable, Vilgax Attacks provides a shallow, though well-done, experience.",70

8271,77,2068,18,"For those who enjoy a simple hack-n-slash game, Ryse: Son of Rome fits the bill. This is no deep adventure, but rather a chance to burn your aggression by chopping your way through hundreds of barbarians, slowing only to enjoy the carnage during the brutal executions.

8284,289,2068,18,"There’s more to Ryse than its glossy exterior suggests, and Marius’ tightly told tale makes for an entertaining journey filled with its share of surprisingly considered carnage, but as the credits rolled, we dreamed about what a sequel might be like.

Upon this we find an overly short story balanced by a valid co-op experience. It's undoubtedly a game to try for every Xbox One owner, but one that you could be willing to wait to find at a more appropriate price.",70

8293,448,2068,18,"Ryse is a title that should be played when you have nothing else to play or are bored with what you do have. But I do not recommend sitting down and playing this from start to finish in one swoop – which you can do, it is only about nine hours – as you will get bored relatively quickly and often.",66

It's pretty easy on the eyes, but everything isn't perfect though. The plot could will keep you playing till the end, but it tastes like déjà vu and it's far too easy sometimes. Above all, Ryse's gameplay would have been a shame in 2003.",65
8297,220,2068,18,"Ryse: Son of Rome is not only a magnificent shell with an inconsistent soul but most of all a colossal wasted opportunity: at the dawn of a new generation, it's sad to see a game so incredibly beautiful to look at, yet at the same time so shallow to play.",65
8298,192,2068,18,Ryse is fun at points but is ultimately held back by its repetitious nature. Still the game is a great way to show off the graphical capability of the Xbox One.,65
8299,408,2068,18,"Action games are not known for being particularly long, but they've gone too far this time. You can enjoy the game – a lot, actually –, but before you realize it will be over, and there's not too many reasons for a second play-through. Unless you're looking for a great-looking game on your brand new Xbox One, there are better options out there.",62
8300,336,2068,18,"It's a gorgeous, dark and bloody tableau. But all that visual beauty and dramatic gravitas goes to waste with an aimless plot and a monotonous combat system. Ryse has all the guts of next-gen — often quite literally — but none of the glory.",60
8301,110,2068,18,"When I show my friends what Xbox One is capable of graphically, I’m going to pop in Ryse. The visuals are breathtaking, but the gameplay flips on a dime between being legitimately fun and downright bad. There is no middle ground. It’s very much the extreme of both.",60
8302,451,2068,18,"It’s easy to see a new franchise in Ryse; one that could potentially rival God Of War if it maintains the momentum of the latter half of the campaign. However, the gameplay is so rote and uninspired that it merely hints at a more robust and rewarding experience that it fails to deliver. Ultimately, it makes for a few hours of passing entertainment, but it’s certainly not one for the history books.",60
8303,148,2068,18,"Ryse: Son of Rome is a splendid technological showcase, probably the most beautiful Xbox One game with Forza 5. Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay it's far below what we would expect from a beat-them-all in 2013.",60
8304,255,2068,18,"Too simple, too linear and way too much QTE that adds nothing. An exceptional visual show for Xbox One, with really great graphics that are promising for the future, but we wish the core game was that good.",60
8305,72,2068,18,"Ultimately, however, while there's fun to be had, Ryse: Son of Rome is a little too shallow to conquer the Xbox One's launch lineup.",60
8306,78,2068,18,"Like the first Gears, Ryse is a simple game loaded with small-scale encounters and rudimentary set-pieces with the intention of hustling you towards something beautiful. Both have their own ‘horror’ stage, both have sieges, both have stationary guns of sorts, and Ryse, like Gears, has room to grow if given the chance.",60

8308,202,2068,18,"Its mechanics are thin, its micro-transactions are annoying and the plot in the campaign makes the story in Call Of Duty: Ghosts look like high art. But if you fancy thumping barbarians and you don't mind the lack of depth, Ryse is arguably the most beautiful hack 'n slash you can play on the Xbox One.",60
8309,391,2068,18,"I almost feel like Ryse wants to be the Xbox One’s Gears of War – a new intellectual property by a studio known for visually stunning games, and a title that can perhaps kick off a franchise.

8310,199,2068,18,"Ryse makes a good showpiece if you've bought into the Xbox One early, but at full price it feels a little thin.",60
8311,204,2068,18,"Ryse has an interesting dilemma. It contains a fun combat system, a fine story and beautiful visuals, yet fails to make an impact. It’s damaged by being painfully short (under six hours), linear and repetitive, the combination of which proves hard to overcome.",60
8312,125,2068,18,"Ryse has the look and feel of a stellar AAA action game, and it even has the makings of a combat system that can be positively compared to the highly regarded Batman games. Unfortunately that combat system remains underdeveloped as the game goes on, and as a result, the game becomes a repetitive trudge through its brief 6 hour campaign.",60

8320,256,2068,7,"Ryse: Son of Rome has amazing graphics and execution scenes. However, it features a bad story, boring fight scenes and linear gameplay.",70
8321,129,2068,7,"Brutal combat and simple mechanics are the “bane and the boon” of this Action/ Hack 'n' Slash game. Impressive in the beginning, grows weary, though, after some playtime, following Marius Titus’ journey for retribution. The stunning depiction of some territories of the ancient Roman Empire make it an eye candy and the extremely interesting multiplayer co-op feature adds extra play hours, making it a worthy buy.",70
8322,143,2068,7,The action fan in me is entertained sumptuously by the brutal battles and the beefy revenge story.,68
8323,298,2068,7,"While the PC port features the same shallow gameplay from the console version, its visual quality is boosted to incredible heights. Ryse may not be a great game, but as a blunt spectacle with impeccable graphics, costly cut-scenes and brutal combat it still can be quite satisfying.",68

8329,355,2068,7,"Ryse is very simplistic, but at least it’s beautiful to look at. No wonder Microsoft made it a launch title for Xbox One – it is an ideal introduction to slashers. Unfortunately, if you have played other, better-designed games, Ryse will quickly disappoint you.",65
8330,255,2068,7,The new version of Ryse for PC is an exceptional visual show for PC with better resolution and FPS than Xbox One version. However it is a linear and too simple Beat'em Up.,62

8336,140,2068,7,"I could never call it good, or imaginative, or varied. I can see through its obvious attempts to appeal to my most primitive impulses. But I can also say that Ryse succeeds in tickling your brain stem even when you know your time is better spent. I don't believe, however, that it deserves congratulations for having done it.",50
8337,226,2068,7,"Ryse is a little better than its reputation as a tech demo in search of a game. But not much beyond a mediocre combat system in want of something more than its predictable, opulent story.",50
8338,430,2068,7,"Even though it looks infinitely better on the PC, Ryse: Son of Rome still remains a dull tech demo that's repetitive and offers very little gameplay-wise. It's very pretty to look at, but extremely boring to play.",50
8339,74,2068,7,"Looking back on this review, I’m actually a bit depressed that the highlight of the game (for me, at least) was simply how good Ryse looked. It’s obvious that Crytek is capable of so much more, but Ryse simply borrows the best that a few franchises has to offer, and instead chooses to cobble them together quite lazily with a few superfluous mechanics thrown in for good measure, rather than refining and building upon the core game.",50
8340,181,2068,7,"This is a sample of an average hack and slash game of the ancient Rome era with the overpolished graphics, that gets on PC thanks to the well-made conversion. Unfortunately, on the inside it is still that empty game like it was a year ago.",50
8341,5,2068,7,"It could have been a decent game, if the fighting system would be more refined, if the AI would react better. Like this it is little more than a tech demo to show the immense power of CryEngine 3. And as this, it is very powerful.",47

8433,195,280,16,It's the first person camera work that brings even this lack-luster world to life and makes up for the simple textures. The first person perspective goes beyond anything that we've ever seen in other games and brings the immersion of the experience to new levels.,83
8434,19,280,16,"Although I really liked Breakdown for its story and first-person implementation and grew to love the combat, some will think it&#146;s a &#147;niche&#148; title with too many idiosyncrasies for a wider audience.",83

8436,271,280,16,"A solid game. The only issue I really have with it is that it's very linear. Once you're done with it, it's not really going to get played again...Namco gets a lot of credit for trying something a little creative in a very crowded genre.",82

8441,9,280,16,"A groundbreaking title and surely a genre-creating one at that. It takes the immersion and realism of first person games to new levels and weaves the action into one of the best science fiction storylines yet seen in a game, with plenty of big twists before the end.",80
8442,394,280,16,"There's something just so attention-grabbing about the game's approach to action and subject, something so intriguing about the story which makes it far more than the FPS-scrolling beat-'em-up early opinions suggested. [JPN Import]",80

8445,50,280,16,"There are lots of buttons, doors, and items to interact with in Breakdown so you can understand how this gets frustrating. Yet, you take this all on the chin because the level design and overall artistic quality of alien beings and their worlds is high.",80

8451,140,280,16,"Ideas aside, however, Breakdown's underlying game design is unable to bear the weight of its own innovation, so it's really just a pretty good action game that you can't help but feel could have been so much more.",76
8452,147,280,16,A poorly executed game with an original concept that is held back by its repetitive action and uninteresting world.,75
8453,110,280,16,"I like that conserving ammo is the name of the game, but found that hit detection was a crap shoot - especially when you're behind cover. [Apr 2004, p.104]",75
8454,113,280,16,"If you're looking for something that's truly revolutionary, you won't find it here, but despite Breakdown's occasionally repetitive gameplay and bland environments, it's a breath of fresh air in a genre that's fast becoming stale.",75
8455,330,280,16,"Even noncombat activities are seen from Cole's view, whether he's eating a cheeseburger or ogling his sexy sidekick. Brilliant. [May 2004]",75
8456,66,280,16,"In many ways, it is a groundbreaking title and is certainly deserving of praise for attempting to do something new, however it fails to be as good as it could have been, resulting in a game that has many fantastic parts that never form a unified whole.",75
8457,142,280,16,"Weird, sometimes wonderful, and certainly unique.",75
8458,91,280,16,It's just not right hating a game which tries so hard to do something fresh.,75
8459,323,280,16,"Pacing becomes an issue too, as you see a conveniently placed line of goodies on the ground that can literally take a minute to retrieve as you sigh, watching the animation. Same goes for opening doors. [Apr 2004, p.59]",75
8460,427,280,16,"An admirable but stilted tilt on the age-old FPS genre. It attempts to do so many things and, perhaps purely through the power of statistics, actually nails a few.",74
8461,31,280,16,"If nothing more than an interesting footnote in the evolution of gaming ideas, it would be a real shame to let this game fade into obscurity without at least coming to your own conclusion.",70
8462,44,280,16,Fans of run 'n' gun games and arcade-fighting titles likely will find that Breakdown is a uniquely enjoyable -- though visually dizzying -- single-player tale.,70
8463,159,280,16,"The learning curve jumps due to the confusion the player feels while trying to get a hold of the camera and the involved combo system turn into a button masher in frenzied fights. Still, the title is worth a look.",70
8464,150,280,16,"Breakdown was meant for a rental from start to finish, assuming you have a strong stomach to handle the first-person camera. Stick with the game and it can offer plenty of satisfying fun to accompany the initial frustration.",70
8465,244,280,16,"On the one side, you have a horrid control scheme that forces combat to be a burden rather than a joy and makes your interaction with the environment slow and arduous. On the other side, you have one of the best presentations in any first-person shooter game ever with an uncanny immersion factor and a nicely directed story to tell.",70

Yet still, this is one of those bad games I couldn't help but enjoy, even as I cursed its very existence.",67
8471,174,280,16,"It doesn&#146;t succeed in making you feel like you are a part of the game&#146;s world, but rather that you are involved in a tedious and repetitive exercise over which you have very shaky control.",67
8472,229,280,16,"The hand-to-hand combat is actually quite fun to use, which more than makes up for the mediocre gunplay you have to use early on.",67
8473,41,280,16,Some aspects of the game could have been tightened up such as the storyline and the combat mechanics but I would equate this game with a trip to the country. It's a little laid back but offers you plenty of breathing room.,60

8524,44,2058,8,Rumble Racing is one fast game &#151; redrawing the graphics on the screen at roughly 60 frames-per-second (twice that of television) &#151; so those with a need for speed should strap in for a ride.,80

There's a ton of content here, and thanks to its lack of an online pass, it actually makes for a great rental as well.",93
8700,197,891,17,Forza Horizon in many aspects orients itself towards the predecessor. But the open world and the festival the game revolves around is incredibly entertaining. Brilliant graphics and the sound of roaring engines round out a great racing game.,92

I've played the game at numerous difficulty settings both with 360 controller and MS Force Feedback Racing Wheel, and have come away impressed.",91
8703,188,891,17,"Forza Horizon manages to feel like something completely different, while retaining enough of Forza's core identity to make it fit really well into this established franchise.

8704,67,891,17,"Playground Games took a humungous, beautiful world, packed it full of entertaining challenges and events, added in tons of personality and style, and built it all around the proven Forza tech, giving racing game fans an exceptional automotive experience that they didn't even know they wanted. For as much as I love Forza Motorsport, it's going to be hard to go back after this.",90
8705,21,891,17,"There's nothing really like Forza Horizon out there right now, as the wide-open world to explore and solid handling of the Forza franchise come together beautifully. Yes, Playground and Turn 10 had to compromise on what feels like a rather hefty list of features and selling points in order to make Horizon a reality on Xbox 360, but the relatively few new things this game includes add up to a massive impact on how it's played and enjoyed.",90
8706,213,891,17,"If you love Forza 4, this is the perfect companion. If you love cars, this is essential. The school of thought may be that it's hard to push racing games this late in a generation, but Playground Games hasn't just moved the needle here. It's buried it.",90
8707,82,891,17,"Forza Horizon is built on the best parts of the Motorsport games but delivers a strikingly different experience to them, and in many ways a better one. It has its own personality. It exchanges infinite laps and bottomless grind for an actual structure and a sense of adventure, while mastering its roads requires less practiced skill than it does courage and intuition.",90

8709,290,891,17,"As a street-legal version of a purebred racer, Horizon is something that anybody with an interest in cars can pick up quickly and play for ages. And if you don't like cars already, well, it might just persuade you.",90
8710,289,891,17,"Horizon may not be the natural successor to Forza 4, but it manages to steer the franchise in a fresh and entertaining new direction. Serious Xbox racers need a lot of room to properly stretch the legs of their Ferrari F-40s and Audi R8s, and Forza Horizon delivers that room - and those wonderfully responsive cars - in spades.",90
8711,99,891,17,"I'm the type of guy who actually goes for Sunday drives. Weird, I know, but it's true. As such, Forza Horizon felt like it was developed just for me. It may not be the perfect title for the F1 fans looking for a classic racing simulator, but for anyone who has ever turned their head as a Lamborghini whips past them on the interstate; this game needs to be played.",90
8712,413,891,17,I find it easy to ignore Forza Horizon's traditional multiplayer when the single-player is so captivating and enriching.,90
8713,448,891,17,"Forza Horizon was definitely a great surprise. Not only does it carry the Forza name, it carries the quality, just in a different form.",90
8714,145,891,17,"While Forza Horizon does have room to grow, it's fantastic for anyone who wants to take to the open road with more authentic driving and car customization.",90
8715,204,891,17,"Not only is Forza Horizon a worthy addition to the series, but one of the most comprehensive racing experiences this generation.",90
8716,129,891,17,"Taking a new turn, the new Forza game delivers an immense world to explore packed with superb graphics and an incredible sense of freedom. It's not a ""Forza Motorsport"" game per se, but it's a great game in any respect.",90
8717,432,891,17,"A breath of fresh air for the series and one that should appeal to fans old and new, Forza Horizon may have toned down on the realism but the open world environment and host of quirky ideas more than make up for any discrepancies. This is a racing game that has plenty under the hood, and leaves you wanting one more shot at racing glory.",90
8718,84,891,17,Horizon represents a successful attempt to morph the notorious racing game into a street racer that could define a new future for the Forza Motorsport franchise.,90
8719,408,891,17,"A great game, full of details that make it shine every time we play. Forza Horizon needs many hours to make the most of it, but just a few minutes to start enjoying it. It also proves that an open-world title could be as deep, profound and interesting as any other game.",90
8720,37,891,17,"At the end of the day Forza Horizon is the racing game I have been wanting for quite some time and Playground Games should be commended. With a good mix of simulation and accessibility, new open road exploration, the freedom to get away from closed tracks, and some great visuals and sound, I found I could not stop playing and neither will you.",90
8721,83,891,17,"The last time I had this much fun with a similar racing set-up, I was playing Project Gotham Racing 2. Fans of the genre should definitely keep an eye on whatever Playground Games decides to invest their considerable talents in next.",90
8722,262,891,17,"Forza Horizon is a great spin-off for the series, great variety and gameplay, gorgeous landscapes, massive soundtrack and nice free-roaming structure. It's hard not to fall in love with. Those who love racing games can't go wrong with Playground Games effort.",90
8723,146,891,17,"Dare I say it, Forza Horizon is arguably the most attractive and all-encompassing racer of the generation.",90
8724,427,891,17,Forza Horizon does a splendid job of bridging together arcade-style and simulation racing into a package that feels like the best of both worlds.,90

8726,34,891,17,"The only thing I regret is that Forza Horizon is only available on X360, a platform that doesn't have a decent steering wheel. Still if I had to choose three games to take with me to desert island, two of them would be Forzas – the latest Motorstorm and the new boundless Horizon. [12/2012, p.64]",90
8727,86,891,17,"With Forza Horizon, Turn 10 was able to truly innovate and create a game that is on a higher level than any other proposal.",90
8728,186,891,17,"Forza Horizon isn't exactly ground breaking, games like Test Drive Unlimited and Burnout Paradise have already tried the open world experience. However Forza Horizon does it better than both and offers up an amazing experience that doesn't stop giving from start to finish, it is simply glorious.",90
8729,89,891,17,Forza Horizon is a game changer. A racing game that can be loved by both passionate drivers and lazy arcade gamers. One of this generation's masterpieces.,90
8730,242,891,17,Forza Horizon pulls off a splendid mix of arcade racing and simulator and impresses both visually and in driving mechanics. The presentation and attitude could be better and the game really flaunts it's coming DLC packs.,90
8731,87,891,17,It would be a mistake to treat Horizon as just a spin-off of Forza because it's an excellent game with its own personality and great ideas.,90
8732,428,891,17,"Horizon sacrifices purity for spectacle, trades tuning depth for racing equality and shifts to an open road setting where once were trackside barriers and preset circuits, though none of this detracts from the glorious driving mechanics that Playground Games has superbly re-created under the watchful eye of Turn 10.",90
8733,430,891,17,"Like a real party Forza Horizon can entertain you for hours. The game offers variation in both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes and looks fantastic. The soundtrack just completes it. Despite a few flaws the franchise took a turn that proves to be good for newcomers, but also great for the fanbase. You can't miss out on this party.",90
8734,63,891,17,"Forza Horizon is not simply a great racing game; it’s a great game in general. From the handling to the visuals and sound, from the tweaking to the reward system, Horizon has everything it needs to be an enjoyable time. It may lack the challenge and depth that fans of the core Forza series know and love but if you’ve admired the Forza Motorsport games from a distance (like me) then do yourself a favor and play this amazing game.",90
8735,415,891,17,Forza Horizon is a great spin-off that delivers pure arcade racing fun in an amazing open world environment – but purists beware: this is not your kind of Forza anymore.,89

8737,192,891,17,"Forza: Horizon turns away from the down-in-the-weeds realism of previous versions to provide a more approachable ride. It's chock full of things to do and races to run, but even just driving through the spectacular countryside provides hours of enjoyment. While it's not strong in innovation in the genre, it does a respectable job of maintaining the status quo.",89
8738,124,891,17,"While it doesn't exactly innovate, there's nothing that could really keep me from recommending this game.",89
8739,5,891,17,"It is tremendous fun to cruise through a breathtaking virtual Colorado, explore and listen to the fantastic soundtrack. On top of that the brilliant driving physics show that the Forza-DNA is still intact and working. But AI problems, a missing split-screen and the reduction to a maximum of eight players online eventually show that there is still room for improvement.",88
8740,321,891,17,"If you love Forza and love exploring, there really isn't any reason why you shouldn't pick up Forza Horizon.",87
8741,140,891,17,"Horizon's occasional missteps may clash with the machinelike precision of the Motorsport games that preceded it, but its ambition and untethered road map more than make up for those faults. This is a game that understands the thrill of the open road, and in delivering that thrill it's an unqualified success.",85
8742,110,891,17,"Forza Horizon is a well-crafted game that offers a fun racing experience that accommodates different approaches. It's not a complete experience, but it's a take on the Forza franchise that does the series proud.",85
8743,139,2394,10,"As Media.Vision’s first crack at the series, Summon Night 6 is a surprisingly solid entry in the series. While we were unable to get our hands on any of the physical packaging that Gaijinworks is known for, their localisation efforts shine through clearly. While strategy RPGs may be harder to come by these days, Summon Night 6 is a thirst quenching oasis for any genre-loving desert travellers.",80
8744,204,2394,10,"Summon Night 6: Lost Borders excellently brings together visual novels and tactical RPGs. Fans of the visual novel portion may be turned off a bit by the English voice-over work, but the story itself is amusing. It may not be the most memorable out there, but it works as a slice of life with a supernatural twist. The tactical RPG portion of the game is its strongest point — and good enough to where any fan of that genre should consider Summon Night 6 to enjoy that alone. It has a much brisker pace than most and keeps the action moving when other games would have a lull. The graphics are strong — especially given it being a Vita game at its core — and the overall audio work is great thanks to a well-crafted soundtrack and strong design.",80
8745,328,2394,10,"This is a colorful and fun VSRPG (I think that works!) with loads of enjoyable characters, an interesting story, and a fluid combat system. While the game might have a bit too much extra dialogue, the story itself is full of charm, doing a great job of keeping you engaged.",80

8747,138,2394,10,"Gaijinworks’ latest game isn’t the big AAA JRPG like Final Fantasy. It’s more intimate, along the lines of Disgaea, and some might say it deserves the same following as that popular series.

If you can't get enough of SRPGs, give Summon Night a shot, but it's not going to click for everyone",70
8750,350,2394,10,"Summon Night 6 is an odd game. As the fifteenth anniversary project for the series, the creators produced an experience that resembles a crossover title rather than a typical mainline game. There is an expectation that players will be excited by each chapter's reveal of characters from an earlier Summon Night game, but can a person have nostalgia for something that wasn't available to experience in the first place? Because of the multitude of characters incorporated, the deep connection with characters and the cute asides that made Summon Night 5 stand out are lost. Ultimately, Summon Night 6 is a visually impressive, mechanically solid strategy RPG, but the repetitive story beats, weak voice acting, and overflowing number of characters keep the experience from shining.",60

I'm not the biggest SRPG fan, but I've enjoyed playing Summon Night 5 and 6 enough to venture calling Summon Night my favorite SRPG series. Unfortunately, the charm that initially won me over couldn't completely save Summon Night 6's storyline from its dependence on nostalgia for something largely unfamiliar to Western gamers. That being said, spending time with Summon Night 6 makes me want to play the Summon Night games we did not get in the West more than ever before.",80

9129,393,821,17,"Overall FIFA 10 plays a much more varied, fluid, and believable game of football, which easily sets a new standard in the genre. We spent a fair amount of time between matches wondering what it takes for a football game to get a 10 and we're inclined to believe Rutter and his team have actually achieved it this year.

9381,188,717,17,"While EA Sports MMA won't be an instant success due to the overwhelming popularity of the UFC name brand, I can honestly say that EA has made a more accurate and solid version of the shoot fighting sport than THQ.",83

Its branding is sorely missed, alongside Joe Rogan's and Mike Goldberg's industry-leading commentaries.",80
9391,84,717,17,"Finally EA MMA walks on the ring to fight against it's rival, UFC Undisputed. The game is really good but the lack of the UFC license is a huge limitation for the most hardcore fighting fans. Anyway, the game is smooth and based on a simple but deep command system.",80
9392,148,717,17,"Compared to the king of the genre, UFC Undisputed, I must confess I have a personal preference for EA Sports MMA, thanks to its accessibility and ""easy to pick-up"" philosophy. UFC remains the deepest of the two, and benefits greatly from its official license, but this first foray of EA on that front really establishes it as a serious competitor. It's especially true if you're looking for online play, where EA's experience is really shining in comparison to UFC. So if you're not already a hardcore fan playing UFC, but just someone who's interested in starting up with something more noob-friendly, EA Sports MMA is just for you.",80

9395,415,717,17,EA Sports MMA is a very good sports simulation with beginner-friendly gameplay mechanics but still enough gameplay depth to be true to the sport of Mixed Martial Arts. The career mode is more fun than the one in its rival UFC Undisputed. However the game is lacking in different game modes. And applying as well as defending arm or leg submissions gets boring too soon.,80
9396,393,717,17,"With a disappointing career mode and less-than-stellar presentation, it's a less complete package than Undisputed. I should probably drop in a fighting metaphor here, I suppose: with MMA, it seems like EA is finding its range with the jab in the first round, before swinging for the fences in the second.",80

9411,52,717,17,"EA Sports have achieved moderate success with their first step into the MMA space providing a game that plays well and contains some promising features that give incentive to dedicated play, however it unfortunately falls short by failing to introduce the player to the game's complexities and missing core issues such as player disconnects cutting stat tracking short.",71

Same graphics and gameplay with very few new goodies make this remake a very interesting one for those who have never enjoyed it, or just for those who loves playing virtual tennis. The new control system isn't as precise as we could hoped, but it's still fun and wide-opened for any kind of gamers.",70

9452,427,1407,14,"The Wii port, New Play Control! Mario Power Tennis, doesn't fare any better now that the product is several years old. Normally, the graphics take the brunt of the criticism but here, it's the control scheme which, by default, makes the game much easier than it should be.",65
9453,413,1407,14,"As much as it pains us to say it, having been big fans of the original GameCube game, the control issues in this Wii port make Mario Power Tennis hard to recommend. Had there been support for a traditional controller this would have been an excellent party game, but as it stands it'll really only be acceptable to gamers who don't know any better - who may well find many of the issues nothing to worry about. For that reason Mario Power Tennis on Wii gets a pass, but we really expected a bit more from Nintendo.",60
9454,82,1407,14,"A decent arcade tennis game but not a classic - and this New Play Control! conversion isn't anything more than a more-or-less functional reboot that gives away a little precision, and doesn't add much in return apart from a sore arm the morning after.",60

9456,123,1407,14,"Controlling characters is a snap with the Nunchuk's analog stick, and the graphics and sound are as delightful as ever. Mario Power Tennis is mildly enjoyable (especially with three friends), but it needed more love to ace the competition.",60
9457,160,1407,14,"Mario Power Tennis doesn't work quite as well with the Wiimote as we hoped for. So if you already played Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube, there is always that feeling that you lack control. And where is the online game mode? Games like Mario kart and Super Smash Bros.

And since playing a standard set is crazy enough with the new controls, adding turtle shells and banana peels to the mix makes the matches unmanageable.",50
9462,228,1407,14,"Mario Tennis has always been a great game. A good pace and variation in shots, some tactic (especially with doubles) and a nice feel of competition. Too bad this “New Play Control!” breaks the game. You’re playing an arcade game with non-arcade controls and that’s not what the game was supposed to be about. It’s inaccurate and frustrating to miss balls and hit them badly while you know this wouldn’t be the case with a GameCube controller in your hands. Mario Power Tennis didn’t need this remake.",50
9463,268,1407,14,After the ball drops it seems strange that the game’s biggest flaw is a control issue that could have been avoided so easily if they just left the original controls in as an option.

9464,242,1407,14,"Four years have passed since Mario Power Tennis was released for the Nintendo Gamecube, but for this released nothing new is to be found except for the addition of a motion sensing control scheme.

9523,22,80,15,Animal Crossing Amiibo Party is not the game that the franchise deserves but some of its minigames have interesting but unexploded mechanics. The presentation and soundtrack are charming but it only makes us wish for a complete game of the series on Wii U. Not everything was bad in my experience but Nintendo could definitely make a better game.,50
9524,279,80,15,"Witty writing and overall charm can only carry a game so far. Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival has those two things in spades, but a barren wasteland of interesting gameplay makes it a party game that falls short of even the earlier 2015 disappointment Mario Party 10.",45

It holds such little content that is actually interesting that most players will find it a waste of their time to play, especially when the far superior Mario Party series already exists.

It's also quite hard to get why FIFA World Cup: Brazil 2014 is sold as an entire game whilst it's more like a big DLC. Of course, all the official content make the game interesting as long as you take it for what it is: a fancy football game far from the demanding gameplay of FIFA 14.",70
9552,345,8,9,"If you've spent a lengthy amount of time with FIFA 14 on the PS4, 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil's visual quality and gameplay fluidity can take some getting used to, but this is still an enjoyable package if you've caught World Cup fever.",70

9596,195,57,17,"Alan Wake is definitely art, and is well written enough to keep my wife and I on the edge of our seats from beginning to end. If I can admit something, and give Alan Wake the biggest compliment I can bestow, I’d tell you that I had a nightmare about the game the night after I completed it. No horror game has ever managed that feat or even come close. It may have taken them five years to kick it out of the door, but Remedy has created a masterpiece.",95
9597,440,57,17,"Now, you can chalk it up to the absolute rush of endorphins I've had simply by having this title in hand after a 5 year wait, but I found it very difficult to find fault in this title.",93
9598,193,57,17,It’s a horror game that doesn’t rely on clunky controls and denying the player supplies to produce tension. It’s an action game with pages of novelized story to read. Yet every element of the game is cohesive and feels right as you play it.,93
9599,321,57,17,"More than once Alan Wake reminded us of books, movies, and TV shows that we love and spend hours with every week; it helped merge the video game experience with those other memorable moments. For once a video game was able to show exactly what it means to create something that brings emotion to the gamer; on top of that Alan Wake was just damn fun to play.",92
9600,260,57,17,"If you're looking for a game with a great story, dense with mystery and suspense and capable of keeping you in constant distress for hours, Alan Wake won't disappoint you. It isn't a perfect game mainly due to the somewhat repetitive action sequences, but its core is in the fantastic plot and storytelling. It undoubtedly is a great and unique experience, and as such it's highly suggested.",92
9601,432,57,17,"Remedy set out to create one of the most intense and gripping story experiences of the year and they delivered on their goals with sublime ease. An utterly compelling cast of characters and the most engaging story we’ve experienced in years means that Alan Wake is a must buy. The best survival-horror thriller we’ve seen for quite some time.

9604,325,57,17,"Alan Wake is a good game. But as well as a recommendation, I'd suggest you take your time with the first play through, because it's a game you can also only really experience once properly. You will most likely play it more than once - but that first time is the real charm of the thing.",91
9605,255,57,17,"Alan Wake is finally here, and it's as good as we expected. Rich environments, great story, superb gameplay, many areas to explore, interesting characters... A great game that is not the ambitious project Remedy wanted it to be, but it's glorious anyway.",90
9606,413,57,17,"Remedy and Microsoft haven't made a perfect masterpiece, but Alan Wake may well be one of my favourite releases of 2010 – an escapade I'm going to remember for a very long time.

9607,50,57,17,"While its not the generation defining game the epic development schedule might've hyped, Alan Wake is still a fantastic, 10-hour-plus play-it-on-the-couch linear action game - with brains required or not depending on your preference.",90
9608,67,57,17,"Anything it could do to irritate the player is quickly made up for with a consistently striking character, intriguing cutscene, or thrilling stand-off against an encroaching force of possessed and gibbering mountain hicks. Alan Wake wears its own anomalous sense of style with pride and that alone earns enough credit to spend on inefficient dodging or unfair ambush attacks.",90
9609,213,57,17,"Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch.",90
9610,408,57,17,"Alan Wake is an entertaining game experience, with and engaging narrative and full of nights of terror.",90
9611,427,57,17,"All in all, Alan Wake is a brilliant piece of storytelling and one that is going to stand out as an example of single-player gaming done right.",90
9612,365,57,17,"An accomplished experiment in narrative: Alan Wake mixes a TV serial structure with a basic action gameplay, building its offer in entertainment with well crafted characters, twists in the plot (it won't be Stephen King at its best, but for an action-adventure game it delivers) and a cool atmosphere. Maybe not worth all the long time it took to come to us, but still a very enjoyable mix, and not one you should miss.",90
9613,123,57,17,The presentation creates a genuine survival/horror ambience that's hard to shake (without the need for excessive gore) and the gameplay shines (no pun intended).,90
9614,289,57,17,"Ultimately, how much you enjoy Alan Wake’s rollercoaster ride depends on how invested you become in its sophisticated yarn. And it’s one hell of a story, capped off by a quiet, breathtaking denouement that makes good on the opening lines of Alan’s initial descent.",90
9615,396,57,17,Alan Wake is an absolutely fantastic title and it was definitely worth the long wait.,90
9616,374,57,17,"Remedy has created a superb video game that uses one of the best written characters in the medium all year to tie its plot, themes and gameplay together seamlessly. Thrilling, frightening and genuinely compelling, Alan Wake is a nightmare players will not soon to forget.",90
9617,161,57,17,"Despite a bit of repetitiveness in the last half, Alan Wake is a spectacular, memorable experience. If you own an Xbox 360, you'll want to own this.",90
9618,249,57,17,"Remedy has done a cracking job with Alan Wake, providing a game that's solid entertainment of the survival horror nature from start to finish. There are some moments where the game does feel a bit 'samey' in terms of design, but with such an engaging and captivating story, you'll feel compelled to drive onwards and see it through to its conclusion.",90
9619,52,57,17,"Despite it's flaws, Alan Wake is not a game you can miss out on.",90
9620,430,57,17,Remedy did an excellent job creating a brand new kind of action thriller. Alan Wake is an awesome game that grabs you by the throat and makes you scream for more.,90
9621,239,57,17,"Alan Wake doesn't revolutionize the video game medium, but it will definitely get inside gamers' heads.",90
9622,448,57,17,"With the gripping story, the chaotic gameplay and brilliant graphics, it is a game that stands out among the best games on the system.",90
9623,293,57,17,"Alan Wake is an absolute masterpiece of great storytelling engrossed in a deep backstory, accompanied with brilliant complementary gameplay to an amazing degree.",90
9624,59,57,17,Alan Wake is arguably the best Psychological Action Thriller game on the Xbox 360 to date.,90
9625,124,57,17,"If games can’t be called art unless they illicit an emotional response from their audience, then Alan Wake could easily take up a spot in the Louvre.",90
9626,263,57,17,"In short, Alan Wake is exactly what ii says on the box, a “Psychological Action Thriller.” You’ll be grasping at straws for most of the game, trying to figure out what exactly is happening in this quaint little town.",90
9627,262,57,17,"It may not be a masterpiece, but Alan Wake is one of the best games we played on Xbox 360 in the last six months. Stephen King fans will love it.",89
9628,146,57,17,"Remedy have proved that they’re not just a one-trick pony, creating a game that’s starkly different to Max Payne but also deeply referential to it. The clever story, great voice work and presentation all work to sweeten an already sweet deal.",88
9629,70,57,17,"Finally, it's here, and I think it was well worth the wait. It's not perfection, but it's a solid effort and an excellent game that 360 owners should be proud to own.",88
9630,9,57,17,There are not many reasons not to buy this game – it’s a bit difficult to get used to at the start and the graphics aren’t as high quality as they could have been. Ignore these minor issues and buy this game – you will not be disappointed!,88
9631,320,57,17,"If there were a game version of Twin Peaks, it would be Alan Wake. The great Pacific Northwest is a magnificently eerie backdrop for a horror story coming to life. It paces the combat and slower moments well, and it's nice not to have to fight every fight: running away works just as good. The overdone narrator voice gets annoying at times, but luckily Alan's musings lessen towards the end of the game. [May 2010]",87
9632,145,57,17,"Alan Wake paints a vivid nightmare that you won't soon forget. It's the freshest take on the horror game in a long time, and every moment feels like it was painstakingly scripted. There isn't much fluff here. That said, the game is lacking in the frills that we've come to expect from a triple-A release.",86
9633,183,57,17,"In spite of the inevitable signs the long development times have left on its gameplay structure, Alan Wake is still one of those titles every psychological action-thriller game lover can’t miss out. But it is also an intense story, with a dense atmosphere, that any videogame lover should at least try once.",86
9634,438,57,17,"This is the birth of a special franchise, end even with its teething problems the beginning has been well worth waiting for. [July 2010, p.77]",86
9635,268,57,17,"A challenging and genuinely frightening experience...As a survival horror, Alan Wake succeeds admirably, and comes highly recommended. But as a self-proclaimed ""psychological action thriller"", it falls short of its ambition.",85
9636,151,57,17,"The game’s sense of scale is extraordinary and lovingly detailed. Not a single asset in any of the expansive episodic settings feels misplaced. At night, the mist, the shadows and the trees bleed together to create a game world that is equally beautiful and unsettling.",85
9637,214,57,17,"Alan Wake is not quite the revelatory experience we hoped it would be, but it’s a solid and entertaining game that’s rich in atmosphere, with good combat mechanics and an intriguing story.",85
9638,4,57,17,"Alan Wake is an emotionally engaging thriller from start to finish; and it's compelling, different and unique too. An excellent third person shooter in its own right, but not particularly frightening or memorable in any way.",85
9639,110,57,17,"If you don’t mind periodically revisiting game design from 1999, Alan Wake is an engaging horror mystery that brings the heart of Stephen King’s style of storytelling to the interactive medium.",85
9640,140,57,17,"Creepy atmosphere, fantastic combat, and clever storytelling make Alan Wake's quest thrilling from beginning to end.",85
9641,228,57,17,"The gameplay isn't the strongest aspect of the game, but the vibe and the story makes Alan Wake a very interesting game.",85
9642,19,57,17,"After so many years in development, it's kind of a relief to finally play Alan Wake and it was worth the wait.",85
9643,204,57,17,"It may have taken over five years, but the delays and development reboot was well worth it as Alan Wake is one of the top exclusives for the 360, and a welcomed new IP several years into the lifecycle of the 360.",85
9644,188,57,7,Arguably the best compliment I can give Alan Wake is that it is a console-to-PC port done right.,91
9645,213,57,7,"Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch.",90
9646,365,57,7,"The real Alan Wake has come. A great game not only from the narrative prospective but also from technical one, without weakness of the previous version.",90
9647,262,57,7,"It has been a long wait, but Alan Wake is finally available on PC and it comes with better graphics and a gorgeous collector's edition that includes both DLCs and some very interesting extras for a bargain price.",90
9648,83,57,7,The mix between intriguing storytelling and near-perfect game design elevates Alan Wake to an extraordinarily finely crafted experience. Even if should you shelf it after its 10-15 hours and never take it out again: This one playthrough will be a lasting experience. Alan Wake is something special that enriches the world of gaming.,90
9649,255,57,7,"It might seem that Alan Wake is essentially the same game that was released on Xbox 360 two years ago. Nothing could be further from the truth. Remedy has worked hard to adapt the psychological thriller to a platform that should never have waited so long. Better graphics, 3D support, and additional content including DLC. The only excuse for not buying Alan Wake for PC is that you already got bored of it on console. Even if so... you should give it a try.",90
9650,64,57,7,Alan Wake is a superb game that will satisfy anyone looking for a slight twist of horror blended into their third person shooters.,90
9651,447,57,7,"Good things come to those who wait - Alan Wake on the PC may show up very late but it is visually a clear improvement over the Xbox 360 version, plays better with a mouse and brings the excellent atmosphere and gripping story to a whole new audience. No couches needed.",89
9652,302,57,7,"The alpha and the omega of the game is the chilling mood. A man from the city, unaccustomed to dangers and hazards, is asked to survive in the middle of nowhere, alone versus all. It is an exemplary drama and as such, the psychological pressure on the protagonist manages to affect us, as well. It's like living the whole thing, like actually being there. [April 2012]",87
9653,320,57,7,"Excellent PC translation is better than the original. Not for the vastly better graphics, but because you can hide the HUD and the game is a game, not a computer assisted interactive experience. [March 2012]",87
9654,197,57,7,"More than just a port, Alan Wake for PC is a must-have.",87
9655,298,57,7,Finally! Alan Wake arrives on PC almost two years after it hit consoles. Was it worth the wait? Yes! Does its age hurt your eyes? No! Should you play it? Definitely! Alan Wake is one of the most creative and thrilling story-adventures we've seen so far – but you shouldn't buy it if you are expecting an action game.,86
9656,296,57,7,"It took its sweet time, but it's still a genuinely skin-twitching survival game with an original twist to the combat. [May 2012, p.78]",86
9657,140,57,7,Killer storytelling and creative demon slaying make the haunting Alan Wake one for the books.,85
9658,38,57,7,"The game just gets weirder and weirder, as you keep playing, and it's an all-in move from Remedy to just keep pushing its story to its absolute limit of insanity. It reaches its zenith of crazy by the last episode of the game, and it's just such a great culmination of everything that's happened before, that if there were such an award as Best One Hour of a Game, Alan Wake would take the prize.",85
9659,192,57,7,"Alan Wake comes to the PC and brings his paranormal curse with him, completely intact. The same defining horror experience is here, occasionally marred by outdated graphics and quirky character animation, but everything else works like a charm. The extra DLC chapters are also included, so book your trip to Bright Falls today...you won't soon forget it.",83
9660,143,57,7,"Indeed, it grieves me that Remedy has placed the survival horror passages comparatively unloving and exhausting in the game, but anger quickly fades behind the the fantastic story. Other developers may gladly follow its example.",82
9661,10,57,7,"You won't find any ingenious plot moments. On the other hand, the story itself is decent enough to keep you playing for some time.",82
9662,48,57,7,"Yet as a finished result and, finally, as a product with an interactive purpose, Alan Wake suffers enough from trying to mix so many influences, ending very close to the ""you love it or hate it"" model. Eventually, maybe these are just the ""pains of childbirth"" for something more complex or for something else as deserving as interactivity, a new „species"" that needs to be judged less for its interactive aspects and more for the ones that regard its style.",82
9663,375,57,7,"Alan Wake is an amazingly good PC port, all things considered, with a fair price point and prepackaged DLC so you get the complete experience without breaking your wallet.",81
9664,184,57,7,"The gameplay feels more like an action game jammed into a horror story. It's a good action game, but it never quite feels like it belongs. Don't let the moments of monolithic combat or the lack of terror throw you off, though. The strengths of Alan Wake's narrative outweighs shortcomings that need to be mentioned, but can't ruin the experience.",80
9665,84,57,7,"Alan Wake is a game that can guarantee 10 hours of spooky shootings to survival horror addicts. The gameplay is not the revolution that Remedy promised in the age of hype, when ""next-gen"" was still synonymous of hardware innovation, but for 20 bucks you can be sure that all the issues and the aging of the game have been already discounted.",80
9666,5,57,7,"The tense atmosphere aged well and still delivers exciting moments two years after the 360 release, while the explosive action is still better than most of recently released shooters.",80
9667,181,57,7,"The long road for the PC with Alan Wake was not in vain. It brings an excitement, fear, anxiety, enthrallment and alleviation. Those are the feelings you will experience all by yourselves directly from the young writer. And that's definitely worth it.",80
9668,34,57,7,"An example of a perfect console-to-PC port – we got a complete game with two DLC's that looks better than the original X360 version. The loading times are very short, mouse and keyboard controls are perfect and even an old PC is enough to enjoy Alan Wake. [April 2012, p.56]",80
9669,240,57,7,Alan Wake is not a flawless game. The combat system is entertaining at first but its magic is killed by unnecessary and numerous action segments. Still the game is a very atmospheric adventure of a very rare kind. [March 2012],80
9670,303,57,7,"""A gripping rollercoaster ride."" - Stephen King. [Apr 2012, p.52]",80

9672,160,57,7,Alan Wake is a decent port with a few console-characteristics that cause a few annoyances. But PC-gamers finally have the option to enjoy Alan Wake's unique and gripping story.,70
9673,142,57,7,"The PC version of Alan Wake includes the two mildly interesting special episodes that debuted on Xbox 360 post-release as DLC. Continuing from the end of the main game, these gritty episodes delve deeper into the psyche of Alan after his adventure in Bright Falls, but rehash themes and environments seen in the first six episodes. They're worth playing if you just can't get enough of Alan and the darkness swirling inside his noggin, just don't expect new environments or a clear resolution to the character's fate.",60
9674,234,2371,7,Anyone who loves a mystery and has an investigative mind will get many hours of pleasure from Still Life.,100
9675,38,2371,7,Certainly the best Adventure Game of 2005 and possibly destined to be considered one of the most elite point and click adventure games ever released.,91
9676,13,2371,7,"Tells a story that is a masterful blend of challenge, characters and story. It is a definite game of the year candidate, and will likely earn a spot on many gamers' list of favorites.",90
9677,47,2371,7,"Screws you in the end with a serious cliffhanger that doesn't actually reveal all the game's secrets. [Aug 2005, p.78]",90
9678,48,2371,7,"The interface was very simple, it was the same point 'n click system but from what I understood, characters had some problems with their paths. The voices used were just perfect and the ambient sounds used to freeze your heart for a moment.",90
9679,320,2371,7,"A very intensive manhunt with a variety of puzzles. It uses the same graphic engine as Syberia I and II, which is to say the game is simply beautiful. [Apr. 05]",88
9680,158,2371,7,"This title will have you hooked from the beginning until the end, and the open-ended conclusion will leave things up to your imagination to figure out.",86
9681,307,2371,7,"Generally enjoyable, with good quality puzzles and an excellent atmosphere. Still Life doesn’t venture far from the typical adventure formula but for what it is, the game is commendable.",85
9682,111,2371,7,"It looks great, it’s reasonably well acted, and while its puzzles are hit and miss, its story is enveloping enough to draw you in and keep you playing.",84
9683,296,2371,7,"The pace may not win over fans of first-person shooters or real-time strategy games, but it's a darn good yarn for adventure gamers who can stomach a double-helping of gore. [July 2005, p.73]",83
9684,211,2371,7,"This murder-detective mystery from the Adventure Company is every bit as gruesome as it is enjoyable, and it certainly had us all engrossed until its eventual conclusion.",83
9685,319,2371,7,"Still Life is a deep game. It’s a splendid adventure with stylish visuals and a shockingly realistic take on detective thrillers. [May 2005, p.85]",80
9686,450,2371,7,"An above-average adventure game with some very well done elements, but it’s nothing revolutionary, either. If you want the best this genre can offer, go out and buy ""Syberia 1 & 2"" instead of Still Life.",80
9687,346,2371,7,A suitably gripping and atmospheric thriller and the transitions between the Chicago and Prague investigations are very smooth.,80
9688,427,2371,7,"With wonderful writing, gorgeous graphics, great voice acting, and realistic sounds, Still Life proves that macabre adventure games are finally coming into their own, although there is still room for growth.",80
9689,147,2371,7,"If you can stomach the disturbing images (I did) and like your adventure games on the dark, sinister side, then take this game for a spin, chances are you will enjoy it in spite of the little problems the game has.",76
9690,213,2371,7,"An enjoyable albeit short diversion for fans of classic adventure games. As usual, this type of game controls better on a PC than a console but the character movement still feels slow and clunky.",74
9691,41,2371,7,"Finally, a game that actually has above board voice talent.",70
9692,445,2371,7,"The story is great, the mystery is intense, and the protagonists are extremely likable. As a result, we found ourselves liking the game a lot in spite of its occasional shortcomings... all the more noticeable as they are because they interrupt what is otherwise a brilliant game.",70
9693,140,2371,7,"Its slavish dedication to convention will scratch the methodical, cerebral itch all diehard adventure game fans have. As a genre exercise, though, it exerts little energy to draw in new players.",67
9694,383,2371,7,"After suffering through baking puzzles I expected a more satisfying ending, and was left feeling angry and forlorn.",65
9695,232,2371,7,"Yet no matter how straightforward Still Life is and how simple it looks, it’s incredibly easy to fall for. Aside from a few unnecessary inflections and misplaced accents here and there, the storytelling and voice acting is superb.",64
9696,99,2371,7,"The lame dialog and acting shatters any real delusions of drama, as do the irritating glitches and the surprise ending, reminding you that this is just a game after all.",60
9697,142,2371,7,It's unfortunate that pointless busywork and a poorly designed and integrated puzzles end up throwing roadblocks in what should have been one of the best adventure games in the recent memory.,60
9698,82,2371,7,"There's a lot that Still Life does well, but in the same way adventure games were doing things well ten years ago. There is therefore no excuse for it to not manage other basic, fundamental elements when rehashing these decade-old ideas.",50
9699,120,2371,7,"I just can't imagine a filmmaker putting me in a situation where, once the movie stopped, I was forced to go onto a website to find out how it ended. I also can't imagine how anyone at Microids couldn't see just what a fatal misstep this lack of an ending was.",45

9701,1,2859,14,"We Ski offers an absurd amount of events, objectives, and extras -- and it's all icing on the mountain, as this would be a great game without most of it. The comfortable motion controls ensure that even a simple, leisurely ski around the resort is usually a joy.",100

9706,448,2859,14,"If you enjoy the typical waggle-sports found on the console Wii Ski will likely please you, if you are still not a believer in motion control there is little here to advance the medium, just a lot of mindless fun to be had.",76
9707,263,2859,14,"For $20, I can't complain, as it was a fun diversion and I appreciated the fact that I didn't HAVE to play the game for 20 hours just to unlock a slightly steeper slope.",72
9708,451,2859,14,"Family Ski comes highly recommended – even if only to soothe the pain of yet another blue-shell-related defeat. [May 2008, p.118]",70
9709,123,2859,14,"While it lacks flashy presentation and over-the-top action, as previously seen with EA Sports Big's SSX Blur, it makes up for the negatives with precise controls that feel like you're actually skiing.",70
9710,41,2859,14,"Even still, I think this is a great game for families and players that don't mind some lighthearted fun.",70
9711,412,2859,14,"And in the End... Most older players won't get an extended life out of We Ski, as the game play can get a bit repetitive, and starts out very easy, though for families looking to play together, it's worth every penny.",70
9712,267,2859,14,"The reality is that longevity is limited to how much the player enjoys swooshing down the snow in the solo game and for some this isn't going to be enough. A beautiful experience, while it lasts.",70
9713,132,2859,14,"I can't imagine playing it top to bottom, but as a discounted novelty to pop in every now and then, We Ski is a good time.",70
9714,140,2859,14,"We Ski isn't a game that will satiate your need for high-speed thrills, over-the-top stunts, and fierce competition. Rather, it's a relatively sedate game in which you can have fun exploring, taking part in friendly contests, running errands for other skiers, and posing for photos.",70
9715,165,2859,14,"For those not seeking a deep, engaging experience, the game will provide a small and simple sandbox to play in, along with solid usage of the Wii's motion controls and the console's newest input device, the Balance Board.",70

9722,147,2859,14,"The $30 price tag isn’t too bad for gamers craving the latest in motion control. But without a real campaign to jump into, We Ski feels like a collection of random, unrewarding races and mini-games.",60
9723,99,2859,14,"We Ski doesn't feel like it's quite ready for prime time, which may be due to the publisher's need to schedule the game to coincide with Wii Fit.",60

9725,144,2859,14,"As a casual game, We Ski works. Sometimes it takes the ""casual"" a little too literally, but its tight controls and impressive physics make you feel like you're mastering skiing techniques even if your heart rate barely fluctuates.",60
9726,178,2859,14,The biggest problem with We Ski is that it’s just not exciting or challenging enough to make most gamers want to keep playing.,60
9727,242,2859,14,"Family Ski offers exactly what you might expect out of a title like this, but there is precious little to be impressed by.

9753,1,967,13,"Everything is put together so well that, unless you've become truly tired of the franchise, Ghost of Sparta is well worth playing. This portable title, while it may not be the best or most original entry in the series, is more than worthy of the God of War name.",91

True, the game itself isn't a revolutionary change from the previous entry in the series, but if you've enjoyed Wipeout games in the past and have yet to play them in handheld form, then Wipeout Pulse is definitely worth checking out.",80

Multiplayer is limited by closing off every other mode but one for play, but at least the game makes good use of the StreetPass feature.

10114,188,194,17,"To use the word amazing would be an understatement when describing how engaging, fun, and addicting the online game is, but it is a shame the same can't be said about the single player game, which leaves Battlefield 3 feeling like a mixed bag that focused heavily on one aspect more than the other.",83
10115,124,194,17,"Battlefield 3 has a near-perfect multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, it also has a sad single-player campaign with a mess of a story (even for a first-person shooter), and the co-op is just barely above adequate.",82
10116,82,194,17,"Battlefield didn't need to be more like Call of Duty to succeed, it just had to double down on what it was already good at.",80
10117,290,194,17,"It's very much one of the year's best shooters, but for all Frostbite 2's volcanic achievements, it's more a triumph of consolidation, blending elements from past games and popular competitors, than a triumph in its own right.",80
10118,413,194,17,"Battlefield 3 isn't quite the Call of Duty killer many were wanting, then, and it's especially jarring to view EA's 'above and beyond the call' marketing brouhaha in light of the fact Battlefield 3 falls to its most damning lows when it's trying hardest to compete with the latter.",80
10119,184,194,17,"You should interpret this final score based on what you really want from a shooter. If you're a resolute campaign player who avoids multiplayer like a shark with a gun, BF3's single-player is simply not up to scratch in a year that has already given us Resistance 3 and Deus Ex. But if online is where it's at for you, Battlefield 3 is going to be one of your games of the year.",80
10120,171,194,17,"Battlefield 3 for the consoles is a big step down from the PC version. Still, it is almost two games in one. We get a six hour outright mediocre campaign without any surprises, but we also get the really unique and totally awesome multiplayer that only the Battlefield series delivers.",80
10121,64,194,17,"This is an online game to the core, built for the long-term enjoyment of millions of fans looking to keep one game in their console for months to come. In that respect, Battlefield 3 is a resounding success, it's just a shame that it didn't deliver where I hoped it would.",80
10122,396,194,17,Your enjoyment of Battlefield 3 will be dependent on what you want out of it. If you are the type of gamer who only wants to play the game for its story then I would highly suggest you rent this game first so that you know what you are getting in to. The multiplayer is really where the fun is here and if you have been a fan of the franchise in the past then you should have a great time here.,80
10123,374,194,17,"The single player game feels as if it has been specifically crafted to 'beat' another franchise. And, while it enjoys a number of memorable set-pieces and some incredible sound design, in tracing over the template laid down by Infinity Ward's series, it inherits all of the weaknesses as well as strengths of that game.",80
10124,242,194,17,"The highly awaited Battlefield 3 gives a twofold impression. There's a single player campaign that looks and sounds great but is extremely linear and scripted and provides no room for thinking outside the box. On the other hand there's a simply fantastic multiplayer mode, that may well be the best multiplayer experience that this year has to offer. If you're interested in multiplayer warfare, then Battlefield 3 is the game for you.",80
10125,378,194,17,Battlefield 3's multiplayer continues to excel at providing a FPS experience beyond just shooting each other with handguns. The single-player barely holds up.,80
10126,165,194,17,"Battlefield 3 ships an unbelievable mutliplayer with a short, unoriginal campaign.",80
10127,202,194,17,"Battlefield 3 was supposed to bring down CoD, and without a campaign – which seems to be DICE's approximation of a CoD experience – this wouldn't have been possible. This is unfortunate, because the instances in which DICE seem to have tried to beat their rivals at their own game have resulted in Battlefield 3's weakest content.",80
10128,389,194,17,"What's most surprising about Battlefield 3 is that even the things that are assumed to be poor are at least tolerable, if not conflicting with the scope of the multiplayer.",80
10129,19,194,17,"All the other components are in place and Battlefield 3 is a good game, but the x-factor of the players is holding it back right now.",80
10130,108,194,17,"The campaign was completely disposable and most gamers can probably skip unless they are questing for achievements – there are some fun mission-specific challenges to earn those. But for gamers looking for a solid multiplayer offering with a heavy focus on cooperative team play, look no further than the expansive gameplay that Battlefield 3 has to offer.",79
10131,142,194,7,"For PC gamers at least, the decision by Dice to lead on our beloved platform has resulted in a game that delivers a truly next-generation feel. BF3 is an absolutely massive experience, but it's the explosive multiplayer mode that makes this the must-have FPS of the year. There's simply no other shooter that lets you wage war on a scale this huge, but even better is the infinite number of satisfying ways to lay the hurt down on your opponents.",100
10132,87,194,7,"Fresh and with plenty of personality, Battlefield 3 not only avoids Modern Warfare's shadow but raises itself as the new king of the genre.",100
10133,148,194,7,"With a perfectible but thrilling solo, Battlefield 3 adds a new weapon to its arsenal. But its main one remains, no doubt, its multiplayer, as comprehensive and awe-inspiring as ever. With killer production values, one will forget the annoyances of Battlelog and Origin. It's a must-have.",100
10134,136,194,7,As a complete package Battlefield 3 absolutely delivers and if you don't have some angry agenda against Origin it's a must-play. The PC version in particular ushers in a new era of graphical magnificence and the disparity between the consoles begs Sony and Microsoft to up the ante. Shooters don't come much better than this and it's a great way to kick off this year's holiday game rush.,100
10135,24,194,7,"There's certainly room for improvement, but there's no denying that so many different aspects of the first person shooter experience being dished out here are best-in-class. The multiplayer component alone is more than worth the price of admission and the solo campaign and cooperative offerings thankfully bring more to the table than they detract. With Battlefield 3, DICE have at long last raised the bar of PC gaming above the long-held bottleneck of console-parity, to bring us a game that's finally worth upgrading for and I dare say it carries with it a potential for a renaissance of the PC first person shooter.",98
10136,197,194,7,"Though the campaign is short and not too demanding, Battlefield 3 is without a doubt the best shooter of the year 2011. The multiplayer mode with its huge maps, brilliant 64 player battles, and the return of the jets is the best thing going.",96
10137,110,194,7,"Multiplayer maintains the high level of quality DICE is known for, and the campaign is the best in franchise history. Outside of the annoying Battlelog and a tacked-on, uninspired co-op mode consisting of six short standalone missions, the only downside to Battlefield 3 is the lack of substantial changes to the multiplayer formula. However, that shouldn't stop longtime fans and newcomers from enjoying one of the best FPS experiences in gaming.",95
10138,28,194,7,"It's pretty easy when it comes down to it. If you're looking for an offline experience, look elsewhere. Battlefield 3 has a decent singleplayer - it's certainly better than some other games I've played recently - but it's not mind-blowing. If it's the best multiplayer game in the world that you're after, get your affairs in order. You're re-enlisting soldier.",95
10139,255,194,7,Battlefield 3 offers one of the best multiplayer modes out there. The Frostbite 2 engine is capable of amazing things in order to show the most realistic war we've seen to date. Its only flaws are an extremely short campaign and a co-op mode that could have been much better.,95
10140,225,194,7,"In closing I would say that Battlefield 3 ups the gaming bar and stands on its own two feet. Its single player experience is stellar, but it fly's to new heights with its multiplayer experiences.",95
10141,408,194,7,"This PC version is without question the Battlefield DICE wanted to do. It is the ultimate and recommended version of Battlefield 3, superior to the console versions. Although the campaign mode and the cooperative missions have much to improve, its competitive multiplayer is overwhelming and will provide hours of fun for months and even years.",94
10142,365,194,7,"The true strenght of DICE's new title is its multiplayer component: massive battles, vehicles, destruction and an exceptional overall polish of Frostbite 2 offer an incredible piece of entertainment and raise the bar for online competition. Coop mode is also enjoyable, although it won't last long: good to have an afternoon's worth of fun with a friend, it makes you wonder why the whole campaign hasn't been made available for this kind of cooperation. As for the campaign itself, it's mostly playable, but still the weakest part: too much Call of Duty style, desperately linear and sometimes too slow, it doesn't add anything new to the genre.",93
10143,4,194,7,"Maybe Battlefield 3's off-line side is a little bit irregular, but its multiplayer options and amazing graphics justify the necessary upgrade of our computers. Those players looking for a game full of innovation will be disenchanted; however if you're looking for an amazing competitive on-line experience, this is it.",93
10144,143,194,7,"As far as games are concerned, this year is over. Farewell, real-life, hello virtual battlefields. Battlefield 3 is going to be our second home for the next few months.",93

10146,89,194,7,This is war. This is what we FPS fans have longed for for years.,92
10147,145,194,7,"It features a stellar multiplayer suite with practically limitless replay value and a mostly forgettable campaign. The coop missions are a nice addition, and to be fair, the single-player is the best in series history, but it still falls short of its contemporaries. Online warfare is intricate and rewarding, but it also presents a learning curve and a strong reliance on team coordination.",92
10148,50,194,7,"Battlefield 3 then, from a campaign perspective, delivers the goods and then some. It's not perfect, but it's bloody close... infinitely more impressive than Bad Company 2 and irrefutable proof that DICE have now firmly stepped into the hallowed ranks of the absolute top-tier developers. COD or not, this deserves a place in your collection - not to mention a place in your heart.",92
10149,41,194,7,"The only thing that is frustrating about BF3's multiplayer mode is EA's new Battlelog service. Battlelog is a browser-based interface that forces PC players to exit their game and reconnect if they want to change game modes. All in all, the function seems tacked-on and cumbersome.",92
10150,320,194,7,"The new flagship of PC multiplayer shooters, and pretty much the best looking game for years. [Nov 2011]",92
10151,447,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is the new baseline in first person shooter games and while the single player is short and painfully linear, you can only admire the atmosphere and the visuals. Multiplayer maps are too small for 64 players and the game needs a patch or two to fix some small issues but otherwise the online play is pretty much spot on - BF3 will be played for years to come.",92
10152,1,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is a game that's informed, not bound, by both its predecessors and its competition. It takes what made the series great in earlier games and marries it to the innovations from more recent BF titles. The single-player and co-op campaigns both have their issues, but the multiplayer component is worth the price of entry alone.",91
10153,195,194,7,"There is no doubt that Battlefield comes with some warts courtesy of a few mission features and the forced inclusion of Origin, but once these are ironed out we should have a title worthy of carrying the series name.",91
10154,192,194,7,It's the next level of multiplayer team warfare with an incredible engine powering it. Get a good PC and enjoy some of the best multiplayer action out there. The bugs can sometimes kick you out of the game. A ton of unlocks will have you playing a long time to get them all. The single player portion is pretty linear and not that interesting.,91
10155,233,194,7,"If solo play is your primary motivator, then it's hard to recommend Battlefield 3 as anything more than an audio-visual treat. The times where Battlefield 3 does its damnedest to go toe-to-toe with Call of Duty are the times it stumbles the hardest. But when DICE is doing what it's always done best, Battlefield 3 is a uniquely mesmerizing multiplayer game with a seemingly endless number of ways to feel like a success. It's not revolutionary, but it's the best Battlefield game, and that's saying a lot.",90
10156,213,194,7,"DICE's adoration of and expertise with the online experience permeates every aspect of its multiplayer. Regardless of the narrative missteps or the occasional glitches, Battlefield 3 offers an unforgettable, world-class multiplayer suite that's sure to excite shooter fans, whether they fired their first bullet in Battlefield 1942 or have just now heeded Battlefield's call of duty.",90
10157,181,194,7,"A great game meets expectations and excels in a multiplayer. However, it isn't a perfect title of its genre as the game's campaign misses several touch ups. Battlefield 3 will definitely hold up among present shooters and with its multiplayer it's going to stick its players to their screens for a very long, long time.",90
10158,170,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is amazing. The single player campaign is definitely the weakest link, even though it's more than just decent. The co-op missions are fun, but online multiplayer is the main reason you should get Battlefield 3. Here, the game doesn't disappoint in any way and stands as the strongest entry of the series so far. This is the best multiplayer experience I've had this year.",90
10159,21,194,7,"Despite some problems, Battlefield 3 delivers right where it counts: online play. The single player mode looks great but is rather limited, and the competitive multiplayer might be a bit buggy and doesn't pull in all of the best features of every past Battlefield game, but it still lives up to the hype - and for those that were disappointed in the beta, it might even exceed the hype - and gives us a wonderful online experience that is unlike any other in the FPS world.",90
10160,161,194,7,"Although its single player campaign lacks some inspiration, Battlefield 3 stands out as the pinnacle of modern day war-based first-person shooters. With its astounding visuals, sound effects and addictive multiplayer gameplay, it's a game that will be played and loved for a very long time.",90
10161,63,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is a great game. The campaign comes off as dull and repetitive after a few hours, but multiplayer continues to be a thrill a minute",90
10162,151,194,7,"The campaign may be pants, and the co-op may struggle to find a niche, but DICE knows multiplayer – that much is evident. In this regard, Battlefield 3 exceeds expectations.",90
10163,262,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is what the fans expected, total multiplayer war in huge maps, where tanks, jets and choppers deliver death to the grunts lying on the ground. Unfortunately the rest of the game is not as great as the online mode. The campaign is short and pretty boring, but visually astonishing and the coop is just a simple add-on.",90
10164,29,194,7,"Battlefield 3's multiplayer is a triumph, and while the single player campaign isn't the most original, or entertaining shooter, it's the online modes that will keep us playing for months to come.",90
10165,246,194,7,"An extremely beautiful looking game that takes advantage of the hardware in every way possible, resulting in an experience that's so huge and fulfilling that it will keep you satisfied for years to come, especially with all the DLC map packs int he pipelines.",90
10166,108,194,7,"Battlefield 3 deserves to carry on the name of its franchise, and it wouldn't suprise me to see it still being played in years to come as Activision keeps churning out its annual Calls of Duty. It's great to see games being designed for the PC in this day and age, and the pace, atmosphere, and level design is neigh-perfect. When a multiplayer game's only downfalls are slight inaccessibility and a mediocre single player campaign, there's something terrific happening.",90
10167,84,194,7,"Battlefield 3 for PC is an excellent game, probably the pinnacle of the whole series. Thanks to eye-candy graphics, it's easy to be hooked up by well oiled gameplay mechanics. The short single player and coop modes are compensated for by a great multiplayer, that gives us a real contender to the Call of Duty franchise.",90
10168,160,194,7,"Just forget the unsurprising singleplayer and you have the best online shooter available right now. Battlefield 3 has so much content that every shooter fanatic will have something to do. The detailed maps, deep gameplay and jawdropping graphics make this the best Battlefield ever.",90

10172,268,194,7,"A great game, and it has largely delivered on all of the pre-release hype. We do however warn you that if you are looking to buy the PC version, don't be surprised if you have some issues. It certainly knocked some of the gloss off the game for us.",87
10173,48,194,7,"It's all a matter of taste, after all. They each provide a certain type of entertainment – when talking about Battlefield 3, it involves a bigger game, more open in its possibilities and more spectacular. But on a longer timeline, less frantic and with fewer Bruce Willis scenes than the mass appeal beast it set itself to dethrone.",86

10177,19,194,7,"There's no questioning the fact that Battlefield 3 brings a lot to the table. It's visually stunning and mechanically very sound in terms of gameplay. The shortcomings that are present, however, keep the game from reaching true perfection.",85
10178,7,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is the most spectacular shooter of this fall, and I doubt that anyone will come even close.",82
10179,171,194,7,"Battlefield 3 is almost two games in one. We get a six hour campaign without any surprises, but we also get the probably best multiplayer of 2011. If you're looking for the latter, look no further than Battlefield 3.",80

10185,63,1997,7,"If you haven’t played Resident Evil 4, it’s still absolutely worth playing. It’s a definite classic that stands along with the likes of Half Life 2 as one of the best games of its generation.",90
10186,192,1997,7,"Resident Evil 4 is still one of the best games ever made, but less-than-ideal mouse and keyboard controls and a barely noticeable texture upgrade keep this PC port from being the ultimate version of this masterpiece that it could have been.",88
10187,296,1997,7,Resident Evil 4 is still a masterful shooter nine years later. Occasional slowdown caused by the locked 60 fps framerate hampers an otherwise great port.,85
10188,448,1997,7,"Including the Mercenaries mode and previous bonus content featuring Ada Wong, it’s well worth the price for anyone who hasn’t experienced the game yet, or enjoyed the original release. For those who played the 360 or PS3 HD releases though, the visual differences here are negligible, and don’t warrant another purchase.",85
10189,188,1997,7,"All of that said, if you haven't played it yet, the $20 that Capcom is asking for RE4 Ultimate is well worth it.",83

10192,84,1997,7,"Almost ten years have passed, but Resident Evil 4 is still one of the most compelling, thrilling and genuinely scary titles of all time. This HD rendition doesn't do miracles graphics wise, and isn't 100% free from small technical issues and hiccups either, but it is definitely worth the price tag for both hardcore fans of the series and for newcomers.",80
10193,257,1997,7,Still one of the best action games ever made and although this is technically the best-looking version it still doesn’t really feel like the definitive one.,80
10194,204,1997,7,"While the mechanics are starting to feel a little dated at this point and the sound effects lack the quality the rest of the game shows, Resident Evil 4 is still one of the greats that needs to be experienced, and the Ultimate HD Edition is the perfect excuse to do so.",80
10195,220,1997,7,"Does it make sense to spend 20 € to play Resident Evil 4 in 2014? Who already knows everything about this 2005 classic made in Capcom maybe is gonna wait for a better offer on Steam.

At last out on PC after years of begging from fans, this game is clearly the definitive edition of the title, with a motherload of content and a welcome graphics-lifting. We enjoy meeting Leon, Ada, Ashley, Saddler and Salazar again in their roles, and with a 20€ pricetag on Steam, this is tremendous value. The perfect time to discover a classic of videogame.",80

10198,37,1997,7,"It does have its ups and downs but taken as a whole, Resident Evil 4 is an example of excellent game design, one that many developers of today should take notes from… or maybe not, because last time they did that, I was seeing quick time events in a Need for Speed game.",80
10199,72,1997,7,"As a near-decade old game, Resident Evil 4 is frequently amazing. As a first time player, there are more than a couple of moments that feel archaic, often frustrating to the point that you may give up playing.

It brings together all of the content found in earlier versions with new textures, all presented in 1080p (or above) and 60 FPS if your PC is strong enough. Unfortunately, Resident Evil 4's controller or mouse/keyboard options are a step back from the superior Wii Edition controls.",70

Resident Evil 4: Ultimate HD Edition is essentially the great PC version we've been waiting for all these years, it is priced quite reasonably and, under normal conditions, I would recommend the game wholeheartedly to fans of the series and newcomers alike, but not until all the bugs have been squashed. Until then, keep your money in your pockets.",60

10217,180,228,7,"There's a hell of a lot to do and it often feels daunting - like a big cross between Sim City and Total War. But it's well worth having a go if you think you're man - sorry, god - enough. [GamesMaster]",91

10219,147,228,7,The scope of this game is huge and there is so much to do it is baffling.,90
10220,187,228,7,"The game still suffers in gameplay because you’ve got to micromanage your population, telling people to go forth and do things one at a time, but at least your metropolis gets to be inhabited by a populous and intriguing people.",90
10221,307,228,7,"The greatly improved presentation is top-notch, sealing the game up very well.",90
10222,213,228,7,"There are plenty of things that I wish the game had included, but the one thing the game definitely needs to do is build a greater sense of personal involvement between you and your worshippers. As it is they mean absolutely nothing to you beyond their occupations.",88

10226,108,228,7,"Black & White 2 takes the same unique play style of the original Black & White and adds a system of objectives to make the game more linear. The result is mixed, but those who enjoyed the original will probably still find plenty to like about the new Black & White.",83
10227,296,228,7,"An excellent response to the criticisms of its predecessor. [Holiday 2005, p.74]",83
10228,140,228,7,"The sequel is less open-ended and more structured. Indeed, this time there's a more coherent story, which makes it feel like a different game. However, this comes at the cost of some of the free-form gameplay that you may have loved from the original.",82
10229,393,228,7,"Having sat down for 12 hours solid to play through the game in one sitting it would be hypocritical to criticise the game too harshly, it certainly has that Lionhead charm by the bucketload and manages to immerse the player in the world of Black & White effectively.",80
10230,450,228,7,"For what it does right, the game can’t seem to keep from dropping the ball. Combat is a key component in many RTS titles, and here the whole concept just falls flat.",80

10232,445,228,7,"Both multiplayer and skirmishing modes which were present in the original game are totally absent in Black & White 2. Thankfully, the single player game is a good deal lengthier than the first game.",80
10233,419,228,7,One of the things which sets Black and White 2 apart from its predecessor is the combat system.,80
10234,427,228,7,"The developers took out the Creature vs. Creature combat, but villagers are less helpless and can do things like get their own food and take care of their most basic needs without your constant supervision.",80

10239,48,228,7,"If you’re a fan of the first B&W and you were just itching to see how your favorite game could get better, you’ll probably be disappointed by the sequel and be left to ask, like me, how on Earth could Peter Molyneaux have released such a game in the first place?",79
10240,111,228,7,"B&W2 has funny bits and strategic bits and dramatic moments and the creature represents at points a fascinating AI with which to interact, but in terms of a game (and I know I probably use this phrase far too much) the total is much less than the sum of the parts.",79

10242,320,228,7,"Better than its predecessor, but what the player gets is tedious and simplistic. Instead of a challenge, there is a three-unit real-time strategy without the strategy. The creature works rather well, though. [Oct 2005]",77

10245,78,228,7,"As an RTS, Black & White 2 is less deep, but just as flexible and responsive – and when creatures, miracles, wonders and large armies are all in play it’s arguably the greatest show in gaming. [Nov 2005, p.94]",70
10246,132,228,7,"Vastly more playable, but still falls short of the series' graphical capabilities and ideological potential.",70
10247,142,228,7,"Unfortunately, in the process of fixing the game, they ended up stripping much of what made the first game so endearing by allowing the numbers to take precedence over the personality. What Black & White 2 gained in competence; it seems to have lost in soul.",70

10257,10,228,7,"Black and White 2 might be one of the shallowest games I have ever played. In fact, I am depressed that a developer like Molyneux has been able to continually botch up awesome-sounding ideas so thoroughly for so long.",59
10258,19,228,7,"The game is gorgeous, features great depth and affords some neat strategic elements. But as time wore on I couldn’t stop myself from thinking that I’d like to be playing a game that is less boring and includes more in the department of ""doing things"".",59
10259,453,228,7,"While ""B&W"" simply was dull and arduous, B&W2 ended up being far too easy to handle with little reason to go through again as the opposite alignment.",55
10260,49,228,7,"Disappointment is the litany of B&W2. As an evil god, I can build prisons and worse...but why? There's no payoff. Pointless minigames that eschew the game's central morality conflict end up being stupid, insulting, and/or infuriating.",50
10261,31,228,7,"The basic problem with B&W2 is that once again you're micromanaging a world for people who are too lazy and stupid to be able to do the simplest of tasks, such as build a house or find someone to mate with, for themselves. It's a real shame.",50
10262,47,228,7,"The cow is missing a lot of the inscrutability - and therefore personality - had in the last game. [Jan 2006, p.49]",40
10263,136,228,7,"The campaign is lackluster both in terms of plot and scope (even the optional ""side"" missions, while still present, aren’t nearly as creative or engaging as the original’s – and where’s my damn singing sailors?).",33
10264,102,33,3,"From trying to unlock every CO to buying all the War Room and Vs. maps to trying to earn the best rank possible, there are enough features in this game to make three games. Advance Wars is pretty much perfect in every category.",100

10269,188,33,3,There is a perfect blend of simplicity and complexity that makes this game so highly addictive.,100
10270,229,33,3,"One of the best aspects of Advance Wars is the sheer amount of things you can do. If you choose not to play the Campaign mode, you can still fight and earn battlefields in the War Room, or can get friends together and play multiplayer on either one GBA or link up to four GBAs at one time.",100
10271,213,33,3,Incredibly intense and amazingly addictive...especially when you learn every little nuance of the game design.,99

10273,187,33,3,"Regardless of whether you&#146;re an aspiring Gen. Douglas McArthur, you are going to love this game.",95
10274,142,33,3,"One of the top strategy games of the year, on any platform.",95
10275,150,33,3,A simply addicting combination of the best RTS and strategy elements make for one hell of a gaming experience.,95

10278,180,33,3,Frighteningly addictive.,92
10279,393,33,3,"For a handheld, the AI of your computer-controlled opponents is surprisingly diverse and complex.",90
10280,282,33,3,"It's brilliant and fun turn-based strategy with more replay value than you could possibly ask for. This isn't boring turn-based strategy where you spend 15 turns setting up your troops to fight the inevitable battle, no sir.",90
10281,94,33,3,"Offering a perfectly balanced and finely tuned experience that proves both addictive and immersive. A very complete and attractive package, overall, and one that everyone will enjoy.",90
10282,281,33,3,The replay value is great and this game will last forever.,90
10283,335,33,3,"Looks uninteresting at first glance, but proves to be a highly addictive title after a long learning curve. [Winter 2001, p.42]",90
10284,120,33,3,"Unfortunately, while Advance Wars devotes the entirety of its gameplay toward a military simulation, there is utterly no thought put towards the moral implications of armed combat. To be honest, such an aspect is not to be expected, as the subject is rarely broached in video games.",90
10285,162,33,3,"In terms of sheer depth and pure gameplay, there really is nothing else on the GBA to touch Advance Wars.",90
10286,209,33,3,"A true sleeper out of left field, packed with depth, style and replay value.",90
10287,14,33,3,"Ingeniously designed, Advance Wars manages to be both in-depth, and instantly accessible, simply because it presents the game in easily manageable chunks.",90

10293,123,450,2,"Strategic word puzzling personified, with tons of activities to complete. What it lacks in frills, it more than makes up in substance, which is something that can't normally be said for a $20 piece of software. It's good stuff.",80
10294,213,450,2,It very effectively translates the engrossing and challenging nature of crosswords to the handheld format.,80
10295,41,450,2,I really enjoyed every facet of the title and only had minor complaints.,80
10296,188,450,2,Crosswords DS is a fun game for those who enjoy word games.,75

10298,293,450,2,CrossworDS is a surprisingly solid game and a fantastic addition to the touch generations series.,70
10299,389,450,2,"Nintendo succeeded in their mission, which was to bring a word puzzle game to the DS that everyone can enjoy. I can definitely see this game as a useful mechanism for individuals who wish to improve their vocabulary or word understanding. However, that improvement can go so far.",70
10300,9,450,2,"If you just want an interesting and slightly challenging way to pass the time then this is a bit too difficult so knock the score down a notch, but if you're a crossword pro then add a point or two - oh, and that six letter word was 'plague' just in case you're reaching for the dictionary.",70
10301,55,450,2,"Nintendo Presents Crossword Collection is a fine product that will appeal to puzzle fans all over, throwing enough crosswords, wordsearches and anagrams at players to keep even the brainiest of DS owner occupied for quite some time. Sadly there are a few elements missing that prevent this from becoming a must-buy title.",70
10302,277,450,2,"With thousands of puzzles, a range of difficulty levels and intuitive controls, Crossword Collection is a good choice for anyone wanting a budget range of wordy puzzles to last. It's not without its problems, but it's a good way to while away a quiet evening and doesn't try to throw any pseudo-educational elements on you.",70

10304,264,450,2,If crosswords and wordsearches are what you want – Crosswords and wordsearches are what you will get.,70
10305,1,450,2,Crosswords is simply a game about word puzzles made for people who love word puzzles -- and that's OK with me.,67
10306,152,450,2,"This game is versatile, and has tons of activities — it’s probably price-competitive with those huge jumbo books of crosswords you can buy down at the Newsagent. But it doesn’t have the same soul, and it denies you such simple pleasures as ignoring the rules completely and entering rude words in all the boxes.",60
10307,275,450,2,"A disappointing case of quantity over quality. [Feb 2010, p.68]",51
10308,242,450,2,"Solving crossword puzzles work just as fine on the DS as it does on the kitchen table. It's a shame that the developers haven't utilized the digital platform the game is on though, just throwing crossword after crossword at the player with no variation or extra material is potential lost. It works, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table.",50
10309,142,450,2,Do yourself a favor and pick up New York Times Crosswords for the DS instead.,30
10310,267,450,2,Any serious puzzler would be strongly advised to look elsewhere for their fix.,30
10311,394,2935,8,The fact that Smackdown! Vs RAW manages to both encapsulate the essence of the WWE while also delivering a highly skill-based and technical beat-'em-up means that even those without a taste for wrestling will be able to enjoy at least most of what the game has to offer.,94
10312,271,2935,8,"This is indeed the best version of WWE Smackdown there has been yet. To be honest, it's really the best wrestling game out there right now.",91
10313,323,2935,8,"Some of the changes are hits, others are misses, but the bottom line is that this is another quality effort from Yuke's and THQ. [Dec 2004, p.102]",91
10314,9,2935,8,"Even with all the minor and major issues I have with this game that aren't fixed for the umpteenth time, the core gameplay is very, very good and improves on the Here Comes The Pain engine in every way, bringing back all the match types (some with modifications) and the all new and great Parking Lot Brawl.",90
10315,136,2935,8,"A wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that make the whole package shine. Online play is a bit of a disappointment, but better than not having any online play at all.",90
10316,30,2935,8,"The best wrestling game on the market, period, exclamation point.",88
10317,316,2935,8,"It’s a very good game, but there’s just not enough improvement, and the big new features like online play and wrestlers’ voices couldn’t have been done any worse than they were.",88
10318,307,2935,8,"A very good game that any WWE fan should play. However, those looking for a leap as huge as ""Here Comes The Pain"" introduced will be disappointed. The much vaunted online mode isn’t nearly as great as it could have been.",88
10319,232,2935,8,"On the one hand it’s a fantastic game, and on the other, so was Here Comes the Pain, which has a good deal of what SvR does and some things that it doesn’t.",88
10320,147,2935,8,"This is the best game yet in the Smackdown series, and the best WWE game on any system. It has its share of problems, but when taken as a whole, this game is almost impossible not to enjoy.",87
10321,108,2935,8,"If you’re a wrestling or a Smackdown fan, you’ll go nuts over this year’s Smackdown! vs. RAW. However, if you’re looking for an in-depth, stat-tracking online wrestling title, you’ll want to hold off for future installments and simply rent this one.",87
10322,192,2935,8,"With a robust story mode, a deeper grappling system and the addition of online play, this is the best wrestling game available today.",87
10323,427,2935,8,"The biggest plus is the fact that it's a whole lot easier to pin, escape, counter, and it's a huge step up in graphics department, although the game's voiceovers and the movement residing solely on the digital pad ruins this for me.",85
10324,180,2935,8,Still the top wrestling game you can buy but it's not without its faults. The series is becoming dated. Here's hoping for a major make-over next year. [PSM2],85

10329,406,2935,8,"The gameplay is starting to get pretty stale, and the online play is a major disappointment. However, the insane amount of match types available, and the best Season and Create-a-Wrestler modes out on the market makes up for it.",82
10330,211,2935,8,"If it were the first I’d ever seen it would be approaching classic status, however we’ve been here so many times before that it’s starting to get difficult to try and argue a case for trading in to get the new incarnation.",81
10331,140,2935,8,"Despite being the first WWE game ever to offer a full roster of WWE voice talent and the first North American-released wrestling game to feature online play, neither of these features live up to their potential, and the other random gameplay upgrades just don't feel like a significant enough progression for the series.",81

10333,311,2935,8,"The best WWE game ever made for the PS2. Why didn't I score it higher? Despite the extra polish and new additions, it isn't that different from what's come before. [Dec 2004, p.70]",80
10334,99,2935,8,"The first wrestling game to offer online matches, but sadly this feature just isn’t up to snuff. You can select either a standard match or a bra-and-panties match, and then after venting your frustrations on a silent, nameless opponent, you’re done.",80

10343,113,2935,8,"Appalling online support, terrible voice acting and only incremental updates to the core gameplay make this a somewhat disappointing instalment, but it's built on rock solid foundations, which means that anyone who enjoys wrestling games will still get a whole lot out THQ's latest title.",80

10489,58,2966,8,"Many will be put off by Yakuza 2's lengthy cutscenes, or bored by the lack of variety in the gameplay; but for those for which the game clicks, it is a title that will be hard to forget. The boldness of its narrative and the confidence of its mechanics make Yakuza 2 a slice of Japanese gaming that is well worth experiencing.",70

10495,195,1896,8,"Not many games can touch you, let alone make you really think about not only the world around you but also your inner persona, who you would prefer to show to the world but often must keep hidden for the sake of keeping up appearances. Play this game.",91
10496,317,1896,8,Uneasy control prevents the game from becoming a ten out of ten but we are still very pleased.,90
10497,187,1896,8,What will keep you going through much of this game is the original story with well written and even better voiced characters and graphics that push the envelope of the PS2.,88
10498,79,1896,8,"I would not call Primal an innovative title, but it has lots to do and TONS of different powers, which the game doles out just about when you start wanting something new.",85
10499,431,1896,8,Primal is one of the best action adventure games I've played.,85
10500,196,1896,8,"It starts off a bit slow, but the more you play, the more engrossed you'll become. That's where Sony Cambridge's true talents shine through. The story, the music, and that imagination factor always seem to steal the show in one of their titles.",84
10501,311,1896,8,"Other than a lack of truly finger-busting battles for die-hard action fans, long-winded cut scenes are Primal's only real concern. The rest of the experience, in all its brain-teasing, high-resolution glory, is a terrific combination of gothic underworld exploration and movie-quality scripting. [Mar 2003, p.46]",80
10502,147,1896,8,"While the visuals and sound are top-notch, combat is seen more as an annoying distraction rather than an enjoyable experience.",80
10503,395,1896,8,"Its funky bugs, ho-hum core plot and flat, unrewarding ending keep me from recommending it to everyone, but the amazing graphics, unrelentingly sharp dialogue and fantastic score keep it high enough that I can say it&#146;s a definite rental.",80
10504,393,1896,8,"A funny game; the opening phase is likely to put off most gamers as it&#146;s too long-winded, slow, frustrating and just not exciting enough; however persevere and you&#146;ll be rewarded with a decent action/adventure title with ludicrously high production values.",80
10505,213,1896,8,"Limited by an inconsequential combat system and basic wander-puzzles. What it does manage to do though is overwhelm us with high-quality production values, wow us with an excellent graphical presentation, and move us with one hell of a killer soundtrack.",80
10506,288,1896,8,"I can't think of a more enjoyable puzzle-based adventure since ""Ico."" Though not without faults, Primal does so much right, you never really want to put it down. [May 2003, p.93]",80
10507,180,1896,8,"Pleasant. It&#146;s challenging without being too frustrating, and it&#146;s attractive without being gobsmacking, full of decent set-pieces without anything that seriously demands a bit of thought. [PSM2]",79
10508,140,1896,8,"Primal's actual gameplay isn't quite as polished or engaging as the game's presentation, but overall, Primal is still easily recommended to those who enjoy exploring their games and not just plowing through them.",79
10509,174,1896,8,"Those with a taste for all things gothic will probably love Primal, as will many other gamers However, its high production values are hampered somewhat by its underdeveloped fighting engine, simple puzzles, and slow pacing.",78
10510,41,1896,8,"Primal is more like ""Soul Reaver"" meets ""Ico."" And let me tell you, it works.",75
10511,188,1896,8,"If there were more combat, the inconsistencies in the environment wouldn't be so glaring, or at least they'd be more forgivable because you'd be busy with other things.",75
10512,142,1896,8,"If you&#146;re an enthusiast of well-designed levels who doesn&#146;t need twitch action to be satisfied, you should definitely give it a go. All others will likely nod off.",75
10513,19,1896,8,"While the story is extremely deep, Primal plays like a button masher.",75
10514,229,1896,8,"If you can look past the shallow combat and limited interactivity, you'll find an enjoyable gothic experience the looks good and has a great story to tell.",75

10516,446,1896,8,"Pure action-junkies may lose patience with Primal (if the prolonged, ""enforced tutorial"" beginning doesn't outright kill them), but those who like to sit back and soak in atmosphere are in for one hell -- one Hell -- of a moody ride.",70
10517,80,1896,8,"Doesn't hold up in the areas that count the most: Its combat is mindlessly repetitive, its puzzles aren't very inventive, and there are often long, boring stretches between the action. [May 2003, p.126]",70
10518,394,1896,8,We&#146;d recommend Primal to those of you who like games to act as a dictator rather than an instigator. And those who find fetching cups off coffee comparable to the heroic tasks undertaken by the heroes of Greek mythology.,69
10519,110,1896,8,"In the end, this would-be epic is nothing more than a series of lock-and-key puzzles - the same outdated concept that developers have been shoving down our throats since the first ""Prince of Persia."" [May 2003, p.80]",68
10520,128,1896,8,"A really nice looking game, and the environments feel like actual places (as opposed to game levels), so exploring them isn't aways that painful. [June 2003, p.53]",67
10521,99,1896,8,"Looks good and plays well, though you have to accept that a tough puzzle or vague objective can bring your progress to a screeching halt at any moment.",60
10522,186,1896,8,"To get any satisfaction from Primal takes a great deal of effort and compassion, and this price will be too high for some of us.",60
10523,132,1896,8,Too bad the slow pace of the gameplay hobbles the cool concept.,60
10524,115,1896,8,"Reminds me of Sony's own ""The Getaway"" - a game rich in atmosphere with gameplay that doesn't keep up.",58
10525,82,1896,8,"A rank combat system, quirky camera and a lack of inspiration at the game's exploration/puzzle core make playing the game hard work.",50
10526,105,1896,8,"At worst, it's a standard adventure game that wastes good graphics, competent voice acting, and an engaging plot. [May 2003, p.71]",50
10527,78,1896,8,"Somebody up there probably regards this as a trailblazing taste of high-concept, one-size-fits-all blockbuster games to come. Consider that, and know true Primal fear. [March 2003, p.92]",40
10528,120,1896,8,It's sad. It boggles the mind to think that this much time was spent on presentation and backstory when none of it resonates in the slightest.,35
10529,74,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 is a delight. It's one of those heartfelt, earnest, and wholesome games that remind you that not everything needs to be dour, competitive, excessively violent, or deep. It's a game in which a blatant clone of Hatsune Miku (or a male character, I guess) grows turnips, bops monsters on the head (and then makes friends with them), and eventually gets married. It's sweet, I love it, and bring on Rune Factory 5.",90
10530,422,2064,6,Rune Factory 4 Special delivers a wealth of content in a charming and engaging package that should keep newcomers and long-time fans happy for dozens upon dozens of hours.,90
10531,349,2064,6,"All in all, it was a great time. Playing Rune Factory 4 Special reminded me of why I was so attracted to these games as a kid and reinvigorated my love for the franchise again. While it does lack some features that other games of a similar genre have added, such as the much needed same-sex marriage or further character customization, it was still a great play. I had so much fun engaging in community events and festivals, exploring wonderful bite-sized dungeons, and getting to know the citizens of Selphia that it’s hard not to recommend this game. There is so much to do and so many different ways to engage with the game that it truly became my favorite time sink of the month.",90
10532,76,2064,6,"While no individual aspect is the best of its kind, the overall package exudes charm and entertainment that is hard to match.",90
10533,55,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is a near perfect farming and RPG title. The frustrating elements are outweighed by the gorgeous styled graphics, the immersiveness of the plot, and the sheer joy that comes from playing this remastered game. It raises high hopes for the upcoming fifth instalment in the series, and it can perhaps be considered a masterpiece.",90
10534,277,2064,6,"We’d give this one a high recommendation to anyone looking for an engaging yet undemanding game for their Switch. With that being said, those of you who have already played it on the 3DS may want to pause before buying it again, as the new features alone do little to justify the cost of entry once more. Either way, Rune Factory 4 Special proves itself to be a modern classic and a shining example of how good this genre can be; make sure to give it a shot.",90
10535,137,2064,6,"Nintendo Switch isn't starving for RPGs or even farm-sim games — quite the opposite. While Rune Factory 4 might not reach the epic heights of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 or Dragon Quest 11 S, and as a simulator, it might get overlooked for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. However, Rune Factory 4 manages to be something else entirely and manages it very well. With its endearing cast, staggering amount of content, interlocking systems, and ability to let you tailor the experience how you want it, Rune Factory 4 Special is certainly an RPG worthy of your consideration.",90
10536,156,2064,6,"Overall, whether you should pick up Rune Factory 4 Special comes entirely down to whether you played the original 3DS version or not. There’s a few new features: some things added to the trophy room to celebrate the series, new cutscenes, and a New Game + mode where you start off married. Plus, it being on the Switch instead of the 3DS allows for a higher resolution and a larger screen whether docked or in handheld mode. That said…there’s not a whole lot of actual content added.",90
10537,272,2064,6,"The Rune Factory franchise lands on Nintendo Switch with a new version of its fourth game, this time in high definition and with more content than ever. Although it was launched a few years ago, if you are looking for a title that you fall in love with and with a good length, this is your game.",87
10538,348,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is a fairly underrated game from the 3DS library that I'm glad got another chance on Switch. If you were ever curious about the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games but perhaps farming wasn't your thing, you should check out Rune Factory 4 Special. It's the most polished game of the Rune Factory series, and if they can improve on Rune Factory 4's formula going forward, I'm looking forward to the future of this series.",86
10539,283,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is entertaining for hours. There is never a moment where I felt like I had nothing to do. The Switch version is an improvement and makes everything look much prettier, but the original 3DS renders still pop up from time to time. Still, farming is an addictive repetition, and the dungeon crawling offers the adventure of exploration, making the romance the cherry on top. Overall, Rune Factory 4 Special is one I can see myself playing for many more hours to come.",85
10540,195,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special proves just how charming and well-written the Rune Factory games can be. The Switch remaster is just as addictive as charming as the original release was fourteen years ago, and looks even better, thanks to an HD makeover. New content and difficulty modes provide no shortage of replay value, making this a great time sink for newcomers as well as anyone itching to revisit the friendships forged in the town of Selphia.",85
10541,35,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special feels like a game where you always have something to do, offering so many different systems to play around with.",85
10542,343,2064,6,"I had a blast from my day to day activities and my time spent with it didn’t feel like nearly enough. I will be playing this long after reviewing it. Rune Factory enthusiasts, as well as newcomers, should certainly give this a go.",85
10543,37,2064,6,"All in all, my time with Rune Factory 4 Special has been great. For a 3DS port, the upscaling of the graphics is well done and looks beautiful in handheld mode. Even docked, the game looks pretty slick. The art style is bright and vivid. The writing makes every character stand out in their own way. Players who are new to this series should definitely check out this title before the 5th game in the franchise drops.",85
10544,411,2064,6,"Simply put, Rune Factory 4 Special is the best game in the series so far and a great showcase for how many different gameplay elements can be combined to create an addictive farming sim RPG formula that's exceptionally difficult to put down.",83
10545,408,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 is absorbing, packed with content and unique features. If you ever thought about combining farm management and JRPG, this is your game.",82
10546,401,2064,6,"Any Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, or Rune Factory fan should definitely check this one out on Nintendo Switch, as it has one of the most charismatic worlds I’ve seen in a game in the genre yet.",80
10547,204,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 is boundless fun that’s a great time to replay after beating to try new things and experiment with different things each time, marry new partners and perhaps take on a harder challenge along the way. Anyone looking for that farming itch with a dash of adventuring should absolutely play Rune Factory 4 Special.",80
10548,279,2064,6,"I enjoyed my time with Rune Factory 4 Special. It caters well to both farming sim enthusiasts and RPG players who want a little more action in between shipping crops and courting that special someone. I do admire the developer’s ability to blend all of this into one cohesive game, as there’s tons of things to do here and it can take hours to accomplish everything. Grinding can be a little grating, but Rune Factory’s positives far outweigh the negatives.",80
10549,387,2064,6,"Whether you want to whet your appetite before Animal Crossing: New Horizons comes out or you're looking for your next fix after blowing through everything available in Stardew Valley, Rune Factory 4 is the perfect second-life for you. You might feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but once you manage to find your focus the addictive gameplay lets you wash away hours of your day in an instant.",80
10550,115,2064,6,"For its flaws, Rune Factory 4 Special brings an incredible life-sim/Action-RPG to the Switch. There are few games in the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons series that match the complexity and fun of Rune Factory 4, and this port has me excited to see Rune Factory 5.",80
10551,427,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 for the 3DS was one of my favorite games in the franchise, and the years have not dulled its qualities. If you enjoy farming, collecting, and casual dungeon-crawling, it's hard to think of a game that does everything as well as Rune Factory 4 Special. It's still a seven-year-old game at heart, and it sometimes does feel dated. Hopefully the upcoming Rune Factory 5 will keep everything that was improved in RF4 and give us a true successor to the 3DS classic.",80
10552,93,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is truthful to its title, this is indeed a special work, mostly thanks to a captivating gameplay and an amount of content that will last many long and good hours. While Rune Factory veterans might not see plenty of new elements here, players taking their first steps in this series will be delighted at the variety of elements they will find here, making this Rune Factory 4 Special a very recommended purchase.",80
10553,350,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is an easy recommendation to any RPGamer who enjoys farming and life sim games, as well as for those casual Stardew Valley fans that wished for more variety in the combat aspects. It’s been long enough since the 3DS release that this game can be enjoyed fresh again, and for those who missed it the first time around, now’s the perfect time to give it a try. I thoroughly enjoyed my time back in the land of Selphia, and seeing everything that made Rune Factory one of my favorite portable game series work so well on the Switch has me even more excited to see what’s ahead for the series now that we’ve sadly left the dual-screen period of gaming behind.",80
10554,365,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 takes a second chance with this Special edition, and while this is definitely the best version of the game, it's hard to recommend it to anyone who's already played the original.",75
10555,255,2064,6,A solid RPG farming simulator with hours of content and thousands of possibilities.,75
10556,200,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special is a delightful game with a ton of content to keep you busy, despite feeling a little overwhelming in the beginning. Good localisation and post-game content around character episodes and a Newly-wed mode will please returning fans.",75
10557,274,2064,6,"For an updated 7-year-old game, Rune Factory 4 Special does hold up fairly well. [Issue #46 – May/June 2020, p. 73]",75
10558,381,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special has so many layers to it that you can’t help but be fascinated by its charm. The town has a tight-knit feel to it, where each character has a unique, delightful personality. The variety in your side quests and the depth of each system can enthral you for hours. And while its combat is perfectly flawed, it’s a decent change to the life sim formula that other games haven’t quite nailed.",70
10559,370,2064,6,"Rune Factory 4 Special seems to be a jack of all genres but a master of none. It’s a fun game with a lot of interesting features, I only wish that the beautiful illustrations of the characters would’ve been portrayed in the gameplay itself.",70
10560,202,2064,6,"This comfortable but clunky reboot of the part farming simulator, part dungeon crawler, part life sim is very much a product of its time.",60
10561,195,2064,1,"Rune Factory 4 is a game that you could easily dive into for twenty minutes or two hours at a time, and it seemingly never ends. There’s always one more thing you can do to improve your station in the town, or the town’s station in the world.",91

10564,348,2064,1,"Rune Factory 4 is a game I did not expect to like as much as I did, proving that it's nice to be wrong about things from time to time. Its addictive blend of farming, fighting, and friend-ing makes for a fun, lighthearted experience that's easy to get lost in for hours at a time.",85

10569,67,2064,1,"Rune Factory 4 isn't the deepest or most structured game out there, but it more than makes up for it with its charm and wide-open freedom. If you are willing to put in the time to learn its varied systems, I think you'll find that this game is an absolute delight.",80
10570,213,2064,1,"Just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means. You'll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else, but at least you can do so with a smile on your face.",80

10578,37,2064,1,"It’s got the charm and outward appeal, as well as simple but fulfilling gameplay to draw in new comers, but it’s also got the depth and versatility that keeps veterans coming back time and time again. What it lacks in the form of a gripping story, it makes up for with rewarding, fun, and simple gameplay that can be enjoyed by everyone.",79

10599,395,1163,8,"From the way the game renders an entire world that you can explore from one end to the next without a single loading screen, to animation that literally trounces anything ever seen in any videogame, to game design that keeps things interesting despite being what some would call “just a fetch quest,” this is a perfect example of the next generation in videogames.",94
10600,213,1163,8,It has that magical feeling that not all games can possess and it's just flat out a joy to play...One of the few games that I can't help but smile and have fun when I'm playing...A true 3D platform/adventure masterpiece.,94
10601,8,1163,8,SWEET PACKAGE. The graphics are gorgeous and gameplay was an extremely nice experience as well as addictive.,93
10602,168,1163,8,"Its charismatic cast, wonderful voice acting, drop dead beautiful graphics, and awesome level design make Jak and Daxter one of the best platform/adventure games I've ever played.",93
10603,110,1163,8,"On several occasions, I found myself staring in awe at the little details Naughty Dog so meticulously included. [Jan 2002, p.76]",93
10604,115,1163,8,"[It] has as set a new benchmark for the platformer genre with its huge environments and gaming freedom. Play this one through, and you'll never look at platformers the same way again.",91
10605,394,1163,8,"An enjoyable remix of all the best that platform adventures have to offer and, ultimately, it can only be your loss if you do decide to pass on it.",91
10606,111,1163,8,Another surprise to me was the great management of textures within the game.,91
10607,444,1163,8,Lush graphics and feature film-quality animation complement the fun gameplay and tight controls.,91
10608,229,1163,8,"Probably the most impressive part of the game is that all of the territory is connected, visually and gameplay-wise. Anywhere you can see, you can get to.",91
10609,446,1163,8,One of the most thrilling games to hit PS2 since its launch.,90
10610,130,1163,8,Simply amazing.,90
10611,142,1163,8,"The nonexistent load times, unlimited draw distance, and non-linear level design go far to establish Jak & Daxter as a classic, but there could have been more innovation to cement its position.",90
10612,44,1163,8,Outstanding polish.,90
10613,132,1163,8,"Its premise is straightforward, yet there’s so much to do and see, along with some sizeable challenges that will test even the brightest adventure veterans.",90
10614,317,1163,8,"Moving from one area to the next is the smoothest I have ever seen in any game. From a technical standpoint, this is truly revolutionary.",90
10615,41,1163,8,"If you love this type of game, if you enjoy being taken into a world that lasts very long, is fun and is not frustrating to play, then this is a must have for your collection.",90
10616,209,1163,8,Jak and Daxter brings back memories of the fun of Crash without killing the character through repetition.,90
10617,82,1163,8,"A decent length for a videogame at roughly ten hours, and it boasts an enormous number of hugely varied tasks to complete and beautiful sights to see. Capped off with an elegant control system and intelligent game design, this is the platformer to bury both mediocre rivals like ""Banjo Kazooie"" and old classics like ""Mario 64.""",90
10618,140,1163,8,"While it generally lacks originality, its tight execution and heavy action elements ensure that things never become dull.",88
10619,180,1163,8,"If a game like ""Devil May Cry""'s a double espresso, heavy on the sugar, then Jak and Daxter's a nice soothing cup of tea. One offers non-stop thrills, but is over almost before it starts; the other's everything you'd expect, and it won't get you especially worked up, but lasts much longer.",87
10620,136,1163,8,"There's no loading time, ever, and you can always see some part of the map, fully animated, from where you currently are. It's a neat trick that isn't fully realized until you a few hours into playing.",85
10621,187,1163,8,"I was a tad disappointed in the slowdowns but, given the beauty of the game, it was forgivable.",85
10622,45,1163,8,"This world is giant: get really high up in the air and you can see most of the videogame. That’s an incredible feat, something I don’t think I would have imagined feasible on the Playstation 2.",83
10623,80,1163,8,"Handily bests the Crash games in every way. [Jan 2002, p.210]",82
10624,14,1163,8,"While it would have been nice to see some new play mechanics introduced or more bosses to fight (only three are in the entire game), most will have a hard time putting the controller down.",80
10625,105,1163,8,"The studio that gave birth to Crash Bandicoot brings a couple of new mascots and new gorgeous 3D world to the PS2. [Feb 2003, p.92]",80
10626,293,1163,8,"A fairly solid 3D Platformer with only a lack of difficulty letting it down. Definitely more worthwhile at the cheaper Platinum price point, and worth a look for all gaming fans.",80
10627,99,1163,8,"The camera is sometimes unwieldy, and for some bizarre reason can only be rotated around Jak, not moved vertically, though there is a first-person view that lets you look around. Beyond that, however, Jak and Daxter is an excellent example of a 3D platformer.",80
10628,120,1163,8,It is Daxter who gives the game its flavor—more so than the relatively anonymous Jak. This flavor is ultimately what sets Jak And Daxter apart from a lot of the other platform games out there.,75
10629,288,367,8,"The limits to which the team has managed to stretch the PS2's capacity are pretty amazing - it's hard to believe this is the same graphics engine that was used in the first game. [March 2005, p.98]",90
10630,41,367,8,"It's quite possible that Champions: Return to Arms is the best hack and slash game ever created. Unfortunately it has been built atop the foundation of ""Champions of Norrath."" So much so that fans of that game may feel somewhat betrayed that Return to Arms is so similar.",90
10631,132,367,8,"As for controls, combat and inventory-sorting are quick and clean. Spellcasting can be frustrating, though, as aiming projectiles is often a trial-by-error process. [March 2005, p.90]",90
10632,317,367,8,"An absolute blast to play, especially with friends online or off. If you love action RPG's then I can't imagine you'd find a better one than this.",90
10633,394,367,8,"The whole experience is beautifully rendered in high resolution, which makes for some sumptuous details in the graphics.",87
10634,320,367,8,The sequel to Champions of Norrath offers a neat and entertaining package of addictive hack 'n' slash action - but is it really that difficult to implement a proper story? [Mar. 05],85
10635,30,367,8,Branching stories break the monotony of replaying the game.,84
10636,190,367,8,It's totally fun and addicting to play.,84
10637,450,367,8,"In fairness to games out there that are sequels, and actually bring something new to the table, to call this game a sequel is to do those other games an injustice. Champions: Return to Arms is an expansion pack, if anything.",83
10638,192,367,8,Multiplayer is THE way to play this game and Champions: Return to Arms adds a few twists to the series.,81
10639,311,367,8,"It's pretty - really, really pretty, with smooth animations, dynamic lighting, and remarkably detailed, solid-looking textures... [But] the story execution falls a bit short. [Feb 2005, p.70]",80
10640,253,367,8,"Over 100 hours of game play through 50 levels of sword-swinging, spell-casting combat, thousands of new weapons and equipment, and two new characters (the fighting furry Vah Shir and the lizardman Iksar) will keep you huffing at trucker speed through the wee hours.",80
10641,111,367,8,"Yet, even with newly included character classes, new gameplay features and a cleaner online system, the fact still remains that Return To Arms is a title with relatively few advancements within the formula.",80
10642,147,367,8,With branching paths that can lead to good or evil and a multiplayer mode that kicks major tail Return to Arms is more hack-and-slash action worth checking out.,80
10643,110,367,8,"Though everything is very well-done, it's difficult to shake the feeling that I've been playing this game since ""Diablo"" came out on PC in 1997. [March 2005, p.124]",80
10644,195,367,8,"It’s unfortunate that this sequel has the blender feel to it, as the original game was a blast to play.",80
10645,63,367,8,"For those of you fans of the original wishing for better online support should definitely check out Return to Arms, because I think it just may have what you are looking for.",80
10646,427,367,8,"The only real weakness of the combat engine at all is the lack of any sort of auto-targeting system, which makes using ranged weaponry frustrating.",80
10647,99,367,8,"Offers enough playability and action to satisfy any action RPG fan, but it lacks the intricate story and involving quests that would lure in traditional role-playing vets.",80
10648,390,367,8,"The number of times I got ripped apart by wild dogs made me regret ever wanting to be a lizard. Didn’t stop me coming back for more, though.",80
10649,187,367,8,"A solid dungeon hack, but after four years of the same, the formula is wearing a bit thin. Return to Arm’s biggest failure is that it feels too much like an expansion pack instead of a shiny, brand new game.",79
10650,140,367,8,"The improvements that Champions: Return to Arms makes over its predecessors are modest, and after four years of roughly the same game, the fundamental formula is starting to feel a little tired.",78
10651,271,367,8,"Solid game, just not that much different than the first.",78
10652,108,367,8,"A better game than the original, but only slightly. With new abilities for old classes, attempts at new classes, and a few new features such as improved online play and ‘side-quests’, this emerges as the spiritual descendent of ""Diablo II.""",78
10653,174,367,8,Hack and slash a-go-go. It’s a good game because the play is pretty much identical to an older good game.,78
10654,263,367,8,"If you liked the Diablo series or the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance series, then you will not be disappointed with Champions: Return to Arms.",78
10655,453,367,8,"It is better than its predecessor, but it hurts itself by trying to employ too many platforming elements.",77
10656,213,367,8,"Those who have played the other games like this could very well be scratching their heads at why they're playing the same game as before. The old thrills are still here and it's possible to get right back into it as before, but the same rush and level of addiction is harder to attain this time around.",76
10657,1,367,8,"Doesn't offer enough of these diversions, subjecting the bulk of the adventuring to an endless procession of serpentine dungeons, where killing some entrenched boss figures counts as variety.",75
10658,62,367,8,"May not be the most original game, but in the end, it’s a fun one. If you want to spend a weekend hacking and slashing alone or with online buddies, you can’t go wrong with this game.",75
10659,323,367,8,"Give Return to Arms credit for maintaining a good level of strategy and balance to the action. [March 2005, p.54]",75
10660,226,367,8,Doesn’t deviate much from Champions of Norrath—not nearly enough to be convincing as a true sequel. It carries the torch from the first game and is still just as fun as the original. Players expecting new advances in gameplay may be disappointed but don’t let that detract you.,75
10661,117,367,8,A great game but the fact that everything it delivers has been seen and done before brings it down.,75
10662,3,367,8,"Novices, however, should start with simpler fare such as the Baldur's Gate games, which are easy budget pickups these days, or the excellent X-Men: Legends for that matter.",75
10663,420,367,8,"An entertaining little dungeon-romp, if you aren’t a wizened Snowblind gamer.",73
10664,142,367,8,"Comes up short in a number of ways. Would you really notice a big difference between playing the last game again on a higher difficulty and running through the new one with your eyes half-closed? That's the $50 question, and it's one that unfortunately must be answered in the negative.",70
10665,164,367,8,This is definitely a genre that needs some serious reinventing.,70
10666,446,367,8,"The players who'll get the most out of Return to Arms are those who didn't play the last game, and perhaps even gamers who haven't touched a hack-and-slash since ""Gauntlet.""",70
10667,136,367,8,"There's a whole new story, working multiplayer, thousands of new items, new mini-games and sidequests, new classes to play, and the ability to play evil and good plot paths. On the other side of the coin is gameplay that most of us have seen before, following the same formula, and not taking any real chances in the process.",70
10668,316,367,8,"Personally, I had fun with Return to Arms, despite its flaws… until the end. I won’t spoil anything, but after 20 hours, one would expect more than the anticlimax at the end of the journey.",70
10669,150,367,8,"A solid game, but largely derivative. Pick it up if you haven't played the first.",70
10670,51,367,8,"A mediocre follow-up to the original Champions of Norrath. Good, but not $50 worth of good.",70
10671,451,367,8,"The almost endless number of weapon, item and location combinations created by its randomly generated environments means you’ll never quite know what lies ahead, while the quest-led action and multiplayer functionality - particularly online - are compelling enough to keep you hooked for hours. [Apr 2005, p.108]",70
10672,80,367,8,"As I paraded through the areas killing similar tiny enemies over and over (even the ""big"" monsters don't intimidate), it took forever to find any exciting rare items to wield. Without those incentives, things got monotonous. [March 2005, p.123]",68
10673,293,367,8,"An improvement over Champions of Norrath, but just doesn't do enough to separate itself from the other games which have preceded it.",65
10674,78,367,8,"Ironically, it’s people who haven’t played Champions rather than veterans who could find the most to like, given that it’s a year’s worth of tweaks and polish on that game’s largely positive foundation. [Apr 2005, p.105]",60
10675,115,367,8,"New spells and powers don’t mean much once you hop into the game’s single-player campaign, as the action is still mash, mash, mash, mash. The level design is just as it has always been, meaning twisting labyrinth after twisting labyrinth filled with hordes of mindless enemies.",58
10676,68,367,8,"But there's hardly anything new here. The plot is paper-thin, and lacks a driving sense of humor or drama to keep you interested. The game-play is just as basic as it's ever been, and frankly, if you've played any of its predecessors, you've slashed and spellcast just this way a million times before.",50
10677,188,1455,13,"Capcom goes above and beyond with the new Vile mode, an additional difficulty level, remixed music, a thirty minute animation, and the Mega Man Powered Up demo. Even better, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X carries an MSRP of $29.99, $10 less than most new PSP games.",100
10678,323,1455,13,"This is where the PSP begins to run away from the DS. Yeah, I said it. [Feb 2006, p.60]",90
10679,142,1455,13,"It's easily one of the best games available for the PSP, and it might even earn the Blue Bomber a few more fans.",90
10680,66,1455,13,It's one of the best games in the series - and now one of the best games on the PSP - and this remake has been done with so much love and care that you'll be unable to turn it away.,90
10681,316,1455,13,"With wonderful aesthetics, some cool extra features, a budget price-point ($30 or so), and short loading times, Maverick Hunter X is one of the most pleasant experiences on the PSP.",90
10682,117,1455,13,The voice acting seems a bit too much for the game but suits the game well and adds some character.,90
10683,9,1455,13,Maverick Hunter X is my favourite PSP game thus far and one of the very best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.,90
10684,311,1455,13,"It’s the best platformer on PSP, and the extra features should hit fans where they like to be hit. [Mar 2006, p.89]",85
10685,448,1455,13,Capcom has taken an extra step in ensuring that this is more than a quick remake with flashier graphics.,85
10686,193,1455,13,"Since Capcom gave it a new splash of paint, remixed the music and added a few extras, rookies as well as veterans should appreciate the update.",85
10687,427,1455,13,"As a $50 PS2 release, this would have been nearly unacceptable. But 30 for a portable version, that plays as well as this one does, is wonderful. Hopefully the rest of the X games follow.",85
10688,147,1455,13,"With the special containers hidden on other levels, new anime cutscenes, and various other additions make this game a worthy purchase for anyone who is a fan of the Mega Man X series.",83
10689,263,1455,13,"Newcomers to the series will be instantly drawn to the simple and exciting gameplay that is a staple of Mega Man, while the new features make it a worthwhile rent for veteran fans.",82
10690,140,1455,13,"Visually, however, this is completely new, with crisp 3D graphics to modernize the experience and some new anime vignettes to help tell the story. Toss in some cool bonus content and the same great gameplay as the original, and you've got a remake well worth playing.",81
10691,253,1455,13,"And even though the graphics look like anime, fans of the original will be relieved that the classic's side-scrolling game play has been left untouched.",80
10692,213,1455,13,"It's a little on the short side, but it's intense, fun and very challenging. The retooled visuals and sound, coupled with truly nifty additions, make Hunter X an engrossing title.",80
10693,41,1455,13,A good game but it lacks replay value. Hardcore gamers could blast through this in a day so they should be advised to rent it.,80
10694,164,1455,13,"A reminder of everything that was great about the series, including the superb control and beaming visuals and sound presentation, and it throws in some new goodies to keep fans shooting well into the future.",80

10697,288,1455,13,"Out of all the releases that have come out in the past few years, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X stands as an example of what every developer should do--actually take advantage of the new hardware and seize the opportunity to add something new. [Mar 2006, p.94]",80
10698,99,1455,13,"At $20 less than most PSP games, there isn't a better value on the platform. Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X does the series proud.",80
10699,184,1455,13,"Veteran players can look forward to the challenges of Vile mode, while newbies will discover a faithful remake of one of the best platformers on the SNES. Yeah, $30 sounds about right.",80
10700,11,1455,13,"What Maverick Hunter X does is provide an intensely enjoyable and expanded alternative version of a classic game, and I suspect a product like this will appeal to two kinds of people. For the old fans, it'll be like an old friend is stopping by to introduce you to his cute sister. For the newbies, it's a great starting point to see what the big deal is.",80
10701,118,1455,13,Irregular Hunter X will satisfy your need for some side-scrolling shooting. The game is exactly the same as the original although with a few changes to keep things fresh. [JPN Import],78
10702,360,1455,13,A pretty picture to look at and a port of an excellent Super Nintendo action title. On the other hand increased slowdown and its short length will restrict Irregular Hunter X strictly to Mega Man maniacs. [JPN Import],75
10703,115,1455,13,"Adds a surprising amount of fresh content to an old hero. Despite its quirks, this is a satisfying handheld platformer. Mega, indeed.",75
10704,293,1455,13,"Fresh, quality content is something that the PSP needs dearly, and just happens to be something that Maverick Hunter X offers in droves. Lovely.",75
10705,80,1455,13,"If you never tried the original, the prospect of replaying entire levels over and over after dying at the boss is probably more than you'll put up with, but fans will appreciate the elegance of Hunter's simplicity. [Mar 2006, p.114]",72
10706,1,1455,13,"While MHX isn't a definitive reinvention of a classic along the lines of ""Metroid: Zero Mission,"" it's a solid re-creation that's been given an exceptional audiovisual upgrade.",70
10707,132,1455,13,"For those faithfully dedicated to Mega Man, such affronts will be perfectly forgivable, but for anyone else Maverick Hunter X proves to be a pretty, if rather pedestrian first outing on Sony's handheld.",70
10708,50,1455,13,"Megaman is straightforward and the exact sort of game that works on PSP. Fast and simple, bright and colourful. [PSW]",70

10715,136,2141,17,"With its truly melon tweaking puzzles and the real life references to the acts and clues that were found during the real life investigation into the Jack the Ripper murders, Sherlock Holmes manages to cross from fictional to factual in a believable way.",75
10716,110,2141,17,"The pacing isn't perfect, and some elements will leave you befuddled, but the twisting narrative holds up to the end.",73
10717,249,2141,17,"Despite the lack of truly compelling gameplay and any kind of replay value, I would still recommend this game due to its rewarding and involving crime and puzzle solving elements, and obviously, because of its strong story.",70
10718,432,2141,17,"Some people would dismiss this as a dull, slow paced historical game – but they would be missing the point. This is a perfect representation of the Holmes world, mixed in with one of the greatest unsolved cases of our time.",70
10719,225,2141,17,"At the end of the day, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper won't appeal for the mass majority due to the genre the game is imitating, however if you were a fan of the point and click adventure game genre, then you've come to the right place.",70
10720,365,2141,17,"Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper is a good graphic adventure, full of funny gameplay Sadly, the technical aspect is poor and feels some 10 years old, but if you can live with that, a good storytelling and plenty of exploration and problem solving will keep you busy.",70
10721,57,2141,17,The game is okay for adventure fans but it suffers from bad visuals and clunky controls.,70
10722,260,2141,17,"Despite the evident technical limits, this was an entertaining game with an interesting mix of first person view and point-and-click gameplay. If you're missing the old graphical adventures you could evaluate buying it, maybe at budget price.",68
10723,408,2141,17,"It has a good story, well-made since the beginning until the end, and both the main character and the nemesis are charming. There is no greater satisfaction for a private detective than to find who is Jack the Ripper.",65
10724,4,2141,17,"Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper is a game with a good story and some great puzzles, but it lacks some very elementary features.",65
10725,52,2141,17,Sherlock Holmes vs. The Jack Ripper is an enjoyable title that is let down by basic flaws such as the controls and unnecessary objectives in the story mode.,60

11125,195,852,8,"Few of the tasks are dreary and boring, the graphics are gorgeous, the music is Final Fantasy grade A, most of the online community is helpful and fun, and you’ll never run out of things to do.",91
11126,271,852,8,"The graphics are worlds apart from ""Everquest Online Frontiers"" and the gameplay is just off the chart as well.",91
11127,111,852,8,"Square managed to capture most, if not all of the addictive, endearing qualities of the genre while retaining a decent amount of good ol’ fashion Fantasy elements.",91
11128,51,852,8,"It is so involving and addictive that perhaps Sony and Square Enix should consider putting a warning label on the box, something like “Caution: life altering game contained within”.",90
11129,105,852,8,"It can be frustrating at times, but it's not until around levels 18 and 20 that the true appeal of the game even makes itself known. [May 2004, p.83]",90
11130,163,852,8,"“Merely” a fantastically addictive, and quite easily one of the very best in the genre to date.",90
11131,186,852,8,The defining aspect of FFXI is the huge amount of time that is required to play the game. Couple that with the fact it is dangerously addictive and soon enough you will find yourself firmly ensconced in your chair not wanting to leave to do anything else.,90
11132,62,852,8,"I absolutely love this game. I can see myself playing it for at least a year. There is so much to do and see and, quite frankly, I’d feel like I was letting my party down if I bailed.",90
11133,159,852,8,Deep character customization and development systems utilizing the series’ unique job system makes the game highly enjoyable and rewarding.,90
11134,147,852,8,Get very comfortable because Final Fantasy XI will have you so engrossed in its superbly massive world that you won’t want to leave your couch ever again.,90
11135,190,852,8,"Its tight game design, multiple chat tools, and nods to story and questing amid the combat-heavy game play make it a worthy choice for those new to or familiar with the MMORPG genre.",88
11136,187,852,8,"As a MMORPG, Final Fantasy XI is definitely one of the best around and for those who enjoy them prepare for hours upon hours of fun.",88
11137,213,852,8,"One of the single most significant releases in the history of the PlayStation 2. Regardless of how many massively multiplayer games came before it and after, nothing this big, this ambitious, or this good has ever graced a home console before -- that's pretty important.",88
11138,180,852,8,"Unfriendly, unwieldy and expensive - but put the time in and you'll be rewarded with the most extraordinary online RPG. [GamesMaster]",86
11139,30,852,8,"This is one huge game, and I’m still discovering people and places some 80+ hours in...Simply put, what makes Final Fantasy XI so great is that it allows you to do almost anything you’ve wanted to do in a FF game and then some.",86
11140,19,852,8,"The clashing of weapons, the whooshing and swooshing of spells, the grunts and roars of monsters, wind passing through a valley, the sound of crashing waves on the shore, they all bring the game to life.",86
11141,142,852,8,"Another great feature is the skill chain system -- like in Square's ""Chrono Trigger,"" weapon skills can be combined for extra damage, and then followed up with compatible spells for even more damage.",85
11142,80,852,8,"It may not only threaten to take over your life, but also frustrate the heck out of you. [June 2004, p.98]",85
11143,132,852,8,"For many, Final Fantasy XI will be the Holy Grail of nonlinearity: a wide-open RPG universe with Final Fantasy flair, defined by its players as much as its developers, beloved for all its flaws. Love it or hate it, there’s nothing like it on your PS2.",80
11144,140,852,8,"Go into this game with the right expectations--knowing, for instance, that this is a time-consuming game that takes a while to get into and isn't dramatically different, at its core, from other online RPGs--and you'll find in Final Fantasy XI a different-enough take on the online role-playing genre that the experience can end up being both rewarding and refreshing.",80
11145,311,852,8,"It's hampered by some of the MMORPG genre's cliche weaknesses - it's a real level grinder with a de-emphasized plot - but the FF magic is still here. [June 2004, p.18]",80
11146,446,852,8,"Aside from the chaining, the core combat system isn't worth getting too worked up about. It's still automated, requiring little more of the player than target selection. There aren't even tactical position bonuses or penalties, which is pretty weak. And forget the player-versus-player, at least in the game's current iteration.",80
11147,44,852,8,It doesn't win high marks for ingenuity. But a massively multiplayer adventure based on this coveted universe is exciting.,80
11148,99,852,8,An incredibly attractive game with a vast world to explore and countless hours of entertainment in store for those willing to make the investment. But we warn you: those who venture to Vana'diel may not be coming back.,80
11149,150,852,8,"The accompanying hard drive is a neat toy, and there's no denying that FFXI is addictive. $12.95/month after the first one, though? That's a fair bit o' jack.",80
11150,293,852,8,"There is so much to do in Final Fantasy XI, go fishing, cook stuff, make armour, join linkshell groups, kill Goblins. The world is Vana'Diel is such a large place, just don't forget to send everyone else postcards.",80
11151,31,852,8,"It has more good points than bad though, at the least it will tide you over until the next generation of MMORPGs hits the streets and at best you will have fun for months, even years to come.",80
11152,453,852,8,"But should this game be placed above ""Everquest""? Should it be played instead of ""City of Heroes""? In the opinion of this reviewer, the answer to both of those questions is no, unless one happens to be a life-long fan of everything Final Fantasy.",80
11153,196,852,8,"This game does convincingly place you into a fascinating world that is seemingly endless to explore. It’s going to take you months to get the most out of it, and that means monthly fees.",80
11154,158,852,8,For the first time in over a year I found an MMORPG I can stand to play for more than a few weeks.,80
11155,164,852,8,"The amount of time required before discovering the nuances that make Final Fantasy XI such an intriguing world for fans of the massive multiplayer online role playing game genre is gargantuan. As such, this isn't a game for the masses, but for the diehards.",80
11156,263,852,8,"Rather a good game, but it certainly isn’t $150USD ‘good’, especially if you can get it on a PC.",80
11157,110,852,8,"Unquestionably the best MMORPG available for the console, with a high potential to eat away at your free time, and possibly be responsible for some ""sick"" days at work. [May 2004, p.99]",78
11158,227,852,8,"It strips away many of the old-fashioned frustrations without eliminating the enjoyable aspects of the genre. Experienced players, however, will be disappointed by the lack of the depth and breadth of a game like ""Anarchy Online"" or ""Everquest.""",78
11159,174,852,8,"Final Fantasy fans will love Final Fantasy XI, but a difficult sign-up process, poor online support, and lack of any kind of in-game tutorial or training may try the patience of those new to the series of games.",76
11160,120,852,8,"I've never had an interest in MMORPGs until now, and since this game has released, I've got a full-fledged addiction (witnessed by my 14 full days of playtime since the PlayStation 2 launch last month).",75
11161,115,852,8,"The game itself is good, far better than the online ""Everquest"" games for the PS2 and even holding up well next to fancier PC MMORPGs. It’s genuinely fun and runs well.",75
11162,188,852,8,It's the first to actually get me hooked on an MMORPG.,75
11163,451,852,8,"Admittedly, the classes and jobs have been wonderfully balanced to make large parties fit together perfectly but this is no excuse for making solo play so difficult for anything but the toughest classes and so distinctly unrewarding. [Oct 2004, p.114]",70
11164,41,852,8,"I would simply advise getting the PC version (providing you meet the system requirements). Otherwise you're going to be spending money, and lots of it, to essentially turn your PS2 into a PC.",60
11165,120,764,7,"The excellent balancing of gameplay and humor make this game a worthy companion piece to VU Games' superlative ""No One Lives Forever"" franchise.",90
11166,427,764,7,"If you love James Bond movies, or Austin Powers, or any of those great gadgets-girls-and-guns flicks, this game will put you right there in the mix. If you like games that have intellect rooming side-by-side with action, you’ll think your fingers off here...This game could be described as ""crack on a CD!""",90
11167,295,764,7,"Everywhere you look there's another cute animation and another cool gadget. Combine this with an addictive research tree and a challenging campaign, and you have yourself a great combination of ""Dungeon Keeper"" and ""Austin Powers"" - just not a very long one. [Oct 2004, p.94]",88
11168,296,764,7,"Its excellent production values and clever design make for a very satisfying package. [Dec 2004, p.104]",88
11169,180,764,7,Anyone who enjoys constant challenge (the gaming equivalent of juggling with chainsaws) will find much to love in Evil Genius. The majority of the game's features function extremely well and the theme is rock-solid throughout. [PC Gamer UK],87
11170,147,764,7,"Yes indeed, it is good to be bad. Elixir and Vivendi have seen to that. Evil Genius will not set the world on fire with its graphics or soundtrack, but the game offers a solid challenge and entertaining experience.",87
11171,211,764,7,"The humour shines through, the base design and the battle against the agents will keep you occupied for hours and hours on end. Graphics, sounds and the whole gameplay looks smooth and solid.",87
11172,108,764,7,"Seems to have been designed itself by an evil genius. A person with above average abilities in the graphics department but a sadistic, or evil, urge to make gameplay very irritating and proceed at a snail‘s pace.",86
11173,300,764,7,Fans of management and tycoon games should definitely not miss this creative and well thought-out opportunity to play the bad guy. Own this game and it will own you back.,86
11174,3,764,7,"The control system is as good as it is mainly due to the well designed interface. As mentioned, the game is reasonably involved so you will have to spend some time learning what does what, but everything, and I mean everything in this game is so easily accessible.",85
11175,110,764,7,"Evil Genius is unique, polished, and more flat-out fun than anything since ""Painkiller."" [Nov 2004, p.167]",85
11176,158,764,7,"Lots of lovely little details and gimmicks, lots of black humor and lots and lots of evil deeds to perform - what else can an evil genius of tomorrow ask from a game?",85
11177,50,764,7,"Like Austin Powers it adopts the faux-Bond villain theme very well, without becoming too camp or dampening the challenges. Above all, it's hugely entertaining and manages to keep dishing out the surprises all the way through.",84
11178,10,764,7,"Although the game suffers from various setbacks, it's still hella addictive and fun to play. Not to mention that the single-player campaign is HUGE, so you'll get hours and hours of fun from it.",84
11179,297,764,7,"A sturdy sense of humour, and canny logic to its proceedings, raise Evil Genius above a noisy crowd. [Apr 2006, p.95]",84
11180,271,764,7,"Now RTS's are generally a little slow for me, but Evil Genius has a few elements that you have to control simultaneously, so you won't have to sit and wait long for something to build or develop.",82
11181,48,764,7,"It has it flaws and shortcomings, but it can also make you laugh out loud on more than one occasion, which is truly something for a strategy where the main goal is world domination.",82
11182,136,764,7,"One of the most addictive, amazing, and even hilarious games I’ve seen come out on this quarter of the year. Bullfrog might be dead, and Dungeon Keeper might be dead, but the creative concepts they inspired clearly are not.",80
11183,19,764,7,"There’s some trial and error early on that could have sunk the whole game, but the depth and style overcome that stumbling block.",80
11184,142,764,7,"A remarkably fun and addictive game that, while not without its flaws, is brimming with enough charm, good humor, and depth to keep gamers occupied for a long time. The bad news is the game has a problem with relaying information to the player that is, at best, annoying, and in one case, almost brings the entire product crashing down.",80
11185,172,764,7,"The lack of tangible information is probably what hurts Evil Genius the most -- alarm systems register for both tourists and spies, minions die without warning, traps are on fire and you often get only one real warning -- generally, it feels like you just don't have anywhere near as much data coming in as you should.",80
11186,431,764,7,"You, as the mastermind, must not only create ways to take over the world, but also develop ways to improve your base so that you have the necessary faculties to do so.",79
11187,213,764,7,"Had there been more interactivity with during acts of infamy on the World Domination Map, less micromanagement for taking care of enemies, more information passing between the map and the base screens, and more useful information about why things happened the way they did, Evil Genius really could have been genius... but in a good way.",78
11188,232,764,7,"Evil Genius is a flawed strategy title very much in the Dungeon Keeper mould, but that doesn’t mean there’s no fun to be had. It’s certainly entertaining enough to keep you playing, but the numerous faults do serve to irk throughout, which ultimately strips away some of the pleasure.",78
11189,445,764,7,"The quirky nature of this game is its strongest point. Evil games are great, but evil games with a little humour are even better.",76
11190,115,764,7,"The rare success of style over substance. It has everything an Austin Powers movie offers, but draws it out over twenty hours instead of two. There are sparks of genuine delight that make you wish the game was balanced better.",75
11191,111,764,7,"Timing and game issues aside, Evil Genius is one of those great strategy games that will appeal not only to strategy fans, but to players who like operating on the wrong side of the law in their games.",75
11192,323,764,7,"The micromanagement portion of lair maintenance and minion development is intuitive and entertaining. [Nov 2004, p.87]",75
11193,420,764,7,"Breaks new ground with its style and premise, but the delivery comes off a bit stale, and there’s no reason to pick this game back up after the first play-through.",75
11194,174,764,7,"It has its enjoyable moments and trap design can be a lot of fun, but overall the game’s pacing and interface issues can make world domination a test of patience.",74
11195,140,764,7,Evil Genius is hampered by some frustratingly haphazard pacing as well as issues with the artificial intelligence of your minions.,73
11196,82,764,7,"Evil Genius overcomes its flaws and ultimately satisfies. Building an evil empire is a good idea, and the way Elixir's constructed the game is thoughtful, enterprising and occasionally inspired.",70
11197,446,764,7,"Its heart is in the right place, but all the funny interrogation scenes can't make up for the fact that you're doing the same thing at the end of the game as you were in the beginning.",70
11198,353,764,7,"So, what is it really like to be an evil genius? Well you can have a fantastic lair, hordes of loyal workers and tons of money but to be honest, it can be boring at times, you see, the truly evil one never gets to do any of the dirty work, they just sit and watch; and what makes it worse is workers that don’t seem to have much between their ears making the ‘watching’ a frustrating task.",70
11199,163,764,7,The high difficulty level in particular manages to cause immense frustration as your intricately laid out plans are once again foiled and you’re forced to start all over again.,70
11200,451,764,7,"Granted, it may be the thick vein of very British humour running throughout the game that takes some credit for holding frustration at bay. However, Elixir has learnt much from the overly-ambitious Republic and, as such, everything about this title feels far more rounded and polished. [Nov 2004, p.112]",70
11201,1,764,7,"Surprising enough as it is for a modern strategy title, the lack of any multiplayer support rubs the last bit of salt in the wounds for a title that could have benefited so much from human competition to cover its weaknesses.",70
11202,117,764,7,"If you’re a keen gamer and not a big fan of the strategy simulation games, stay clear of Evil Genius as it won’t bring you any satisfaction as opposed to a leading FPS game out on PC these days.",70
11203,78,764,7,"While there are awkward moments on this malignant management escapade, it’s never less than charming. The exaggerated ‘60’s spy-movie design is familiar and entertainingly fresh, and although flawed, it’s still far more appealing than Republic. [Nov 2004, p.104]",70
11204,11,764,7,"Extremely effective in immersing you in the world of world domination and espionage, while maintaining a wonderful sense of humor... Nonetheless, the slow pacing, imperfect sense of direction, and extensive micromanagement can interfere with your enjoyment.",70
11205,47,764,7,"In spite of its missing sandbox mode and the crappy economic meta-game, Evil Genius has a groovy conceit, bright and unique art direction, and a rewarding and well-conceived base-building component. [Dec 2004, p.87]",70
11206,453,764,7,"Just an average game. It started out strong, but then it simply lost steam toward the end.",68
11207,226,764,7,The building and base development aspects are fun but the more you play the more the global overview feature feels like an unwanted distraction.,60
11208,384,764,7,"Players have no real interaction with the despicable duties beyond sending out waves of underlings who can be attacked without warning. Progress requires patience, juggling priorities and micromanagement. Fortunately, the flaws are softened by many clever ideas; it feels good to be bad.",60
11209,132,764,7,"The concept behind Evil Genius is a great one, but the individual pieces of the game don't balance as well as they could. [Dec 2004, p.128]",60
11210,105,764,7,"Despite all it's going for it, Evil Genius just isn't fun. The gameplay is dull, and there is nothing left after you get beyond the initial novelty. [Nov 2004, p.140]",60
11211,164,764,7,It's a shame to see all this potential wasted. It takes a true and determined criminal mastermind to get through this game with all its flaws.,60
11212,99,764,7,"It has tons of potential and just begs to be liked. And we do like it. After all, this may be the first game that can play itself while you’re playing something else.",60
11213,141,764,7,"As a micromanagement/god sim, it makes a fair effort with its source material, although you'll often find yourself bogged down in petty details, and it can lose a bit of charm in its eventual endgame phase.",60
11214,97,764,7,"But where ""Dungeon Keeper 2"" was graceful, elegant, superbly tuned - possibly the perfect RTS - Evil Genius is clumsy, boorish, frustrating, and frankly not worth the price of admission.",60
11215,31,2208,8,"While tennis games do have a set type of person who will like them, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 performs so well that I can’t imagine anyone disliking it unless they want a much simpler version (in which case buy the original Smash Court Tennis for the PS one).",90
11216,354,2208,8,"Another refreshing innovation in Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 is the directional control that you have over your serves. None of this “press left to hit a wide serve” malarkey here my friends, just pure analog control.",90
11217,19,2208,8,"The Pro Career mode is the meat of the game. Here, Smash Court 2 is a revelation.",88
11218,50,2208,8,One of the most addictive sporting experiences ever presented on a console.,87
11219,30,2208,8,"There’s a load of gameplay here, and it’s too bad there’s no online component or Memory Card battle feature for those who want it (hint, hint).",85
11220,180,2208,8,"Easier on the eye than ""Virtua Tennis 2,"" but lacks the diving ability of that game. Otherwise it's perfectly balanced and offers all the tension of the real sport. [PSM2]",85
11221,323,2208,8,"This is just a great all-around tennis game. [July 2004, p.78]",83
11222,414,2208,8,"If you want a great looking tennis game that offers more than just quick and simple play, Pro Tournament 2 offers almost enough to keep you going until next summer, when doubtless we’ll all go tennis mad again. Now leave us alone: Wimbledon’s on.",83
11223,111,2208,8,"Visually, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 is one of, if not the best-looking tennis game on the PlayStation 2.",81
11224,271,2208,8,"An incredibly solid game. If you’re a big fan of tennis, you’re sure to like the character selection, and will definitely dig the inclusion of the professional tournaments and stadiums.",81
11225,446,2208,8,"The best tennis game in years...Whether it's rapid-fire one-off matches or a protracted solo mode that floats your boat, the game has you covered with a brilliant mix of rowdiness and realism.",80
11226,389,2208,8,"A multi-player crowd-pleaser. Mind you, even that is outshone by the benchmark title of the DC's ""Virtua Tennis 2"" (yes, even though I know they're practically the same game).",80

11235,62,2208,8,"But it lacks long-term appeal, and so, its final score likewise suffers. As for SCPTT2 outdoing Pong, after 20 years, people still play Pong, but by the end of 2004, very few will play Smash Court 2.",79
11236,108,2208,8,"While Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 attempts to go with the sim approach, there’s no denying that ""Top Spin’s"" fluidity, ease, and beauty make it more accessible to casual and hardcore gamers alike.",78
11237,80,2208,8,"Greater emphasis is placed on timing and position to execute effective shots on the court, which makes it a little more difficult to get into than ""Virtua Tennis""-style games, but ultimately more rewarding. [Aug 2004, p.104]",77

11239,140,2208,8,"Though a lot of players will find the less-forgiving-gameplay style of the game to be a bit of a turnoff, this is still a solid game of tennis, and it's the best one to have appeared on the PlayStation 2 in years.",75

11241,450,2208,8,"It does a lot of things right, good graphics, multiple play modes, originality and solid on-court action. The pro tour mode is fantastic despite its frustrations. It is refreshing to see some originality in a tennis title.",75

11243,132,2208,8,"Even with the clever new “missions” and spruced-up visuals that make watching a ball go back and forth worthwhile, control is the most important part in tennis; and in this game, Smash Court faults once again.",70

11246,394,2208,8,"For our thoughts on Doubles in Smash Court 2, take the implied criticism of the last sentence, breed it with a retarded monkey suffering with diarrhoea, square the answer and you'll have some idea how awkward a mode this is.",68
11247,188,2208,8,"The creative Pro Tour Mode, visuals, and timed button gameplay are highlights. Though you’ll probably want to fast forward past the limiting pro player controls and dull Pro Tour AI.",67

11448,390,808,8,There&#146;s not much innovation here &#151; the gameplay is far too linear and there is too much emphasis on key searching to trigger the next cut scene &#151; but for atmosphere alone it is hard to beat.,80

11460,78,808,8,"A victim of its own success. By creating a story and an atmosphere so far in advance of what we have come to expect from a videogame, it throws harsh light on the conventions we accept without question in lesser titles. It maps out just how far there is to go in marrying sophisticated narrative and meaningful interactivity. [Feb 2004, p.96]",70

Yet all its terrifying beauty, with a better-judged difficulty and the problems with the second character ironed out, FF2 could have been the finest game in the horror genre.",70
11463,451,808,8,"Exploring the lost village is a terrifying experience that's enhanced by a greatly improved graphics engine and a well-structured soundtrack. Tecmo's latest effort may be flawed and far from innovative, but it's still an enjoyably scary experience. [Feb 2004, p.114]",60
11464,31,808,8,As for actual challenge or feeling of gaming accomplishment it doesn&#146;t always succeed in making its mark and it falls all too readily into genre clich&#233;s that are already beginning to look stale. A finger across the lens really.,60

11472,31,2815,13,"The game is good fun if a little frustrating. Fans of the original might be a little miffed by the drastic shift in dynamic, but as long as you recognize that this isn't just a side-scrolling beat 'em up, you should be pleasantly surprised.",70
11473,3,2815,13,While Viewtiful Joe did not turn out to be the best PSP game around we have to credit the developers for at least trying to make a portable style game out of something which really belongs more on the home consoles.,70

11480,312,2815,13,"It becomes an exercise in just jabbing buttons and hoping. [June 2006, p.72]",60
11481,293,2815,13,As a fighting game Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble just isn't that enjoyable. In the transition to the PSP the game really hasn't changed from the GameCube version. It's an advantage being able to play the game on the run - the game can be a lot of fun in short bursts - but it's disappointing that the developers didn't really make any improvements to the gameplay with the extra development time enjoyed by the PSP version.,60
11482,314,2815,13,"Pitching all the characters into a frantic, objective-based free-for-all, and dressing it up with the visual panache that developer Clover Studio does so well means Red Hot Rumble is a unique and superbly enjoyable button-mashfest.",60
11483,63,2815,13,"The fast-paced scrolling fighter aims for a gentle introduction for PSP gamers, but ends up being too simplistic, despite its excellent visual quality.",60

11487,413,2815,13,"A foray into the beat 'em up genre isn't exactly straying too far from Joe's roots, but the game hasn't been pulled off with the same high level of polish that the other Joe titles exude.",50
11488,117,2815,13,"Unfortunately the same problems that plagued it before are back again, and just because it’s now portable doesn’t necessarily make it enjoyable this time around.",50

11490,117,2815,4,"While the addition of a second player character would have been cool had the co-op mode made the cut, without it Sylvia's presence seems a bit pointless. Nevertheless, a strong outing for the only guy I know that can make pink and red lycra sexy.",90
11491,389,2815,4,"Does such emphasis on multiplayer make it a bad game? Not necessarily. But solo gamers who've been spoiled with previous games may not appreciate the new gameplay style. Thus Viewtiful Joe's epic saga continues, with justice and style for all.",80
11492,147,2815,4,The game has some amazing graphics and a style that is hard to match. If you've never played a Viewtiful Joe game and you want a quick experience then RHR is a good place to start.,72

11497,132,2815,4,"The problem, however, is that there's simply too much going on. It's usually a mystery who's winning in any given level, or even where you are. The seemingly arbitrary point system means you can win all the levels, yet still ultimately lose.",70
11498,140,2815,4,"The style and attitude are available in spades, but unfortunately the battles just feel sloppy and unsatisfying. There are some great singular mechanics in play here, but they're all just tossed together in a mess of flashy effects and shallow gameplay.",69
11499,280,2815,4,"You'll sincerely want to accomplish goals, unlock characters, and share the experience with friends, but the game's got so much on its spinning plate there's no way to grow reasonably accustomed to any one aspect, and it's far too frenetic to be pick-up-and-play friendly.",65

11503,180,2815,4,"The goals, while repetitive, offer more than a typical four-way smasher, but damn, it's hard to keep things straight. For gamers who like things categorically insane, you're looking at a go-to, button-mashy party game.",60
11504,82,2815,4,"There's a mess of nerves that throb confusedly beneath its borrowed face. It looks about right, certainly, but you'll need more than immunosuppressants to stop your face exploding in outrage half the time.",60
11505,239,2815,4,"As a Viewtiful Joe fan, I'm pretty disappointed in Red Hot Rumble. The game isn't bad, but it isn't great, either. It's average, when it gets down to it, really.",60
11506,41,2815,4,Loading the game into your machine is like unleashing Pandora's box. You'll either love it or loath it. Keep the aspirins handy in case of headaches.,60

11746,387,1201,9,"For the most part Killzone 2 is utterly, mesmerisingly brilliant and polished to perfection: the gunplay is solid, the controls, once tuned to your liking are superbly weighted and intuitive and the action, when good, is relentless.

To put it short, this game makes ""Gears of War 2"" look like a high school attempt at gaming and that is a HUGE compliment!",99

11755,325,1201,9,"Considering the worth of a lengthy campaign offering genuine challenge, thrilling local multiplayer with A.I. bots, and a layered online multiplayer component that's likely to be PSN's main point of attraction for the foreseeable future, it's clear Killzone 2 has taken the ever-so popular wheel, slapped a gorgeous chrome rim on it, drastically reduced its tyre profile, and applied a sense of balance never before felt on a wheel. Why then would anyone want to reinvent the wheel when the damn wheel never looked so good or rolled so well?",96

11760,255,1201,9,"Killzone 2 rises from the ashes of the E3 2005 trailer to prove itself as even better; the most outstanding, immersive and technologically advanced first person shooter available for any console on the market. The dark and grim world created by Guerrilla hosts a crude conflict on Helghast soil, divided in 10 acts packed with a variety of situations portrayed with an epic tone. With a polished enemy AI, a huge multiplayer, a well balanced and powerful arsenal, 7.1 sound, great voice acting among some other strong points, few complaints can be made; only the lack of coop and some roughness in the allied AI. The rest is faithful and loyal to the promise Guerrilla made 4 years ago. Mission accomplished.",95

Using Guerrilla’s proprietary ‘deferred rendering engine’ Killzone 2 squeezes a lot more juice out of the Ps3 than anything we’ve seen thus far.",95

11764,426,1201,9,"It seeps action from every angle and makes you question whether you are actually in the middle of a war zone thanks to it’s stunning effects and sound. If you want eye popping, pant wetting action then this is most certainly the game for you.",95
11765,28,1201,9,"It's not a Halo killer, but like Rocky versus Apollo Creed Killzone 2 would last the fifteen rounds.",95
11766,427,1201,9,"It's clear that Sony and Guerrilla Games wanted to strike back at the naysayers, and they've done it in the best possible way by delivering a game that exceeds all expectations.",95

11768,67,1201,9,"I've not had this much fun with a console FPS in a long time, and feel confident in saying that Killzone 2 is probably the best of its kind to come out this generation. While some flaws are evident in the story and a number of design choices, they pale in comparison to the purity of the gunplay and the meaty action that prevails.",95

11772,213,1201,9,"The single-player experience is a truly enjoyable campaign across the Helghast home world that will test your skills, particularly on the higher difficulty levels, and the game simply looks phenomenal for a console shooter. But perhaps the strongest segment of the game is the extremely deep multiplayer, which gives seven basic classes with which you can create your own customized super-soldier after performing your class-specific duties.",94
11773,268,1201,9,"For all its guts and glory, for all its taxing, gritty fortitude, Killzone 2 adheres too strictly to the rules of its genre to send itself into the stratosphere. What will stand the test of time is its pitch perfect grasp of said genre, its wonderfully taxing, take-no-prisoners assault on your senses and your trigger finger. It is the ultimate conservative First-Person-Shooter, whether it wants to be or not. And this is why it’s worth your bucks.",94
11774,147,1201,9,"This is quite a ride on several fronts – visually, aurally and in intensity. You will be challenged, but more importantly, you should have a lot of fun.",94
11775,365,1201,9,"Killzone 2 is a unique experience. The intense single player and a compelling ""Call of Duty""-style multiplayer deliver an impressive package by themselves. If you add an outstanding engine and design, what you get is the masterpiece everyone was waiting for. The only drawback is the plot, weak and affected by bi-dimensional characters. Since plot isn't really the core aspect of a shooter game, Killzone 2 is still a must buy for every genre fan, and it raises the bar for every future production.",94
11776,262,1201,9,"Killzone 2 is truly a tour de force from a technical point of view, but also a game with solid gameplay. Its strengths live in variety and high involvement for the players, even with a cover system that needs some improvements. The Multiplayer side is equally strong (even more), so any PlayStation 3 owner should at least consider buying it.",94

11778,324,1201,9,"A pure, stripped-down, focused shooter that handles the fundamentals of firstperson violence better than any other titles before it, while also managing to be the best-looking game on the PS3 by quite a margin. Bring on the multiplayer.",93

Without the cell-processor and its amazing power, the game couldn’t support as many light sources as it does at once. Without the PlayStation 3, you cannot get the Killzone experience anywhere else. If that was the game’s goal, to prove that point to gamers, than they’ve done their job, and given PS3 owners one hell of a title in the process. The single player definitely hurts without cooperative play, but the multiplayer and overall stunning presentation should earn Killzone 2 a spot on any gamer’s shelf.",93

11782,223,1201,9,"For a developer whose previous games have been little more than average, Killzone 2 is a landmark achievement. Guerrilla has pushed the boundaries of what we’ve seen on PlayStation 3 by creating an all-action shooter that’s far closer to the original E3 teaser trailer than we could ever have imagined. It’s not perfect, sure, but it’s arguably the best FPS on PlayStation 3 and one that is, in this reviewer’s opinion at least, superior to ""Resistance 2.""",92
11783,145,1201,9,"While Killzone 2 is not re-imagining the genre, it’s solid, beautiful, and challenging, with excellent multiplayer that makes it well worth the 60 bones. It falls short of legendary, but it’s sure to offer anyone who takes the plunge a visceral, tactical treat for the thumbs and eyes. It may be tough to get into, but once it gets its hooks in it won’t let go.",92
11784,41,1201,9,"If you're a PS3 fanboy and were a little bit jealous because your ""Xbot"" friends were loving it up with Gears of War 2, don't worry too much. Killzone 2 is every bit as engaging as that title is. In fact, the story and characters are much more interesting and, dare I say, the graphics are even better. However, the lack of co-op features is a substantial misstep; anyone who has gone through Gears 2's Horde mode, blasting away with their buddies can tell you that.",92

As a reviewer who's constantly in search of games which try new things or buck expectations, Lost Planet 3 was quietly, calmly fantastic. Everything about it has a very mature, measured approach which sets it apart from the pack, and the character work on display is some of the best I've seen in quite some time.",85
11789,430,1324,9,"Spark Unlimited has drastically changed the Lost Planet formula, making Lost Planet 3 feel more like a reboot than a sequel. The gameplay feels tighter and more accessible than ever, but comes at the price of the diversity and openness found in previous titles. Fans of the series might not like these changes, but the big amount of content, beautiful environments and exciting boss battles make this a quality title that stands above the average third-person shooter.",75
11790,111,1324,9,"If it wasn’t for the world itself and the characters in it, I wouldn’t have gotten as far in Lost Planet 3 as I did. That’s most of my recommendation right there. Whoever wrote this game needs to get more work, ideally in an original series so he or she can really shine.",75
11791,320,1324,9,Lost Planet 3 has small levels and horribly long load times. That's not a good combination for a game that tries to maintain an illusion of semi-open-world gameplay. The RPG elements add a welcomed depth to the proceedings. [Sept 2013],75

11793,230,1324,9,"We believed in Lost Planet 3. Capcom wanted to come back to the origins of the series, focusing on solo mode and had some good arguments to get us absorbed again by the planet EDN-III's atmosphere. Everything is here: a nice character, efficient gameplay, and interesting content. But nothing really makes Lost Planet 3 a really big game. Graphics aren't that impressive, really commonplace and the game lacks of rhythm and epic moments. Nowhere near the first episode.",70
11794,326,1324,9,"Part three of the Lost Planet series is good, but a bit disappointing as well. The story's interesting and the characters surprisingly engaging, as they wander around an atmospheric world that's definitely worth exploring. The action, however, is quite repetitive and the pacing's more than a little awkward. Audiovisually, the game is mediocre at best. Lost Planet 3 could (and should) have been a lot better.",70
11795,395,1324,9,It's a shame that the ominous atmosphere and touching story aren't backed up with quality gameplay. Lost Planet 3 takes the series in a whole new direction but unfortunately it doesn't head down a unique path.,70
11796,286,1324,9,"Technical errors and slow inputs drag the game's best moments down with them. The slow controls really become a problem when you are fighting more nimble enemies in a small, confined space. Sci-fi fans will get a kick out of Lost Planet. Everybody else will pick it up from the bargain bin. [September p.60]",67

11800,241,1324,9,"After the last installment of the saga, Lost Planet 3 makes up in terms of story line, with a very well constructed plot that will redeem it in the eyes of the fans.

11801,84,1324,9,Lost Planet 3 has lost the appeal of the original chapter and fails to compete with other TPSs such as Gears of War and Dead Space. The Campaign is boring and it lacks interesting elements.,60
11802,255,1324,9,"With a few eyes on Alien, The Thing or EA's Dead Space, Capcom make use one more time of an external western developer to carry a project. Spark Unlimited brings us back to where we shouldn't have left, to the frozen landscapes of that lost planet in a prequel where mechas are not carrying guns. Simple, straightforward entertainment, drive a gunless mecha and explore lost space ships in this TPS with touches of survival horror is fun, but there's nothing in this game we have seen a few times before on bigger titles of the genre.",60

11815,72,1324,9,"Lost Planet 3 isn't a lost cause. There's some genuine emotion to be found in its storyline and a spattering of variety to its combat, but this is marred by unoriginal core gameplay and lackluster level design.",40
11816,377,1324,9,Two positive things to take away from everything is that it is arguably the best game Spark have ever produced and is not as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines.,40
11817,242,1324,9,A somewhat shaky but original and entertaining game series has in Lost Planet 3 been dumbed down to boring gray matter. Everything that made the series unique has been removed and replaced with a story focused game that no one asked for. The story in and of itself is alright but it doesn't salvage Lost Planet 3 since you still have to play an utterly awful game to experience it.,40
11818,70,1324,17,"Spark Unlimited's take on EDN III is engaging and fun. It's not going to turn the genre on its head or come away with any game of the year awards, but it is the best in the series and makes the franchise relevant again.",82

Capcom trusted a mediocre studio from California and let them create a new installment in a well known series. Fortunately everything went ok.

Puzzle design is fairly good, but there’s awful lot of pixel-hunting and running to and fro. The plot twists are good but the overall storyline has many flaws.

A game like this isn’t played for its very realistic graphics, but to challenge the brain and to get stuck in the mood. It doesn’t have any replay value, but for the price of thirty euro’s you can’t go wrong. Fun title for fans of the genre.",74

12058,242,2003,9,Resident Evil Revelations managed great with its technical limitations and delivered a game more built on atmosphere and tension than on pure action.

12059,430,2003,9,"Revelations is an okay game, but too simple a port from the 3DS game. Game technical it’s one of the greatest horror games of the last years, but that says it all. It has the same defects as the 3DS version and it’s too expensive for that.",60
12060,181,2003,9,"A last year's model that's been brushed off, proving that bigger is not always better. This one serves well while waiting for the next ""big"" Resident Evil title.

12067,432,2003,17,"More like the survival horror Resident Evil should be and less the balls-to-the-wall actioner, Resident Evil: Revelations almost strikes the perfect balance between scares and playability. It's arguably the best Resident Evil game we've played since Resident Evil 4, and that's saying something.",80

12072,41,2003,17,"Is Resident Evil: Revelations better for the console than it is for the 3DS? Nah, not really. It adds a few extra features and gives it a coat of HD paint, but at its core it is still the same game. But is it worth playing on console? Absolutely.",76
12073,284,2003,17,"People who missed Revelations the first time around will find an enjoyable and fully fleshed out Resident Evil experience - while not spectacular, it's certainly closer to the original games in terms of atmosphere than the modern outings. RAID mode and Infernal difficulty also offer compelling reasons for Revelations veterans to grab the HD version.",75
12074,157,2003,17,"It offers up a decent amount of missed opportunities, but still manages to capture some of the magic that Resident Evil was known for.

12077,260,2003,17,"A solid RE episode, with a great porting job from the 3DS version and sporting a good balance between pure action and survival horror. If you're missing the older games in the series, this could please you.",75
12078,184,2003,17,"It doesn't last all that long, and the wonky difficulty spikes early on may deter some players.

12079,413,2003,17,"A great port of a good game that has a few problems, the result being something well worth picking up if you’re looking for some decent home console Resi action, or just something to get rid of the lingering taste of Resident Evil 6. Although this re-release is somewhat surprising, it is far from unpleasant.",70
12080,82,2003,17,"This HD edition builds subtly on the 3DS foundations, but thankfully doesn't crush them under the needless AAA junk that has dragged the series so far off course.

12087,192,2003,17,"Resident Evil: Revelations doesn’t live up to its title. The closest thing to a revelation is that you can construct a story out of nothing but betrayals, double-crosses, and weightless twists. Even worse is that the gameplay, while fun in small doses, suffers from a long list of poor design decisions that will surely scare off anyone trying a Resident Evil game for the first time.",65
12088,233,2003,17,"Resident Evil fans will want to see the story, and will forgive the design flaws and wacky dialogue. For everyone else, the game doesn't hold the HD spotlight well. This was a quality handheld title, but on a larger screen it falls into the middle of the pack.",60
12089,161,2003,17,"As an HD edition of a 3DS game, Revelations is the best Resident Evil game since Resident Evil 4. But clumsy controls, bad voice overs, a brain dead plot and some technical flaws still proves Capcom has a way to go bringing the franchise back to its former glory. Being a hybrid between a horror game and an action game, it’s hard to see what the developers wanted to achieve. But even with all this, it’s still better than Resident Evil 6.",60
12090,120,2003,17,"The developers had a full year to get this game ready for consoles and bring it up to the level of current RE titles. Instead of doing that, they shifted the graphics from 3D to HD. What a waste.",55
12091,195,2003,10,"Resident Evil Revelations is another great addition to the franchise. It maintains the survivor-horror feel that the series is known for. The campaign isn’t the longest, but it is engaging and well worth the time. Raid mode is fun to go through afterwards and try out different weapons. Altogether a satisfying challenge and a very enjoyable experience that I had a hard time putting down.",85
12092,22,2003,10,"This new version of Resident Evil Revelations could be considered as a really lazy port. Albeit it has improved visuals and better framerate, and includes all of its DLC, sadly it doesn't offer anything new that stands out from its previous last-gen versions. Yes, it is a good game, but is basically the same title that many have already enjoyed.",84
12093,448,2003,10,"Really, for those that have already played Revelations, there isn’t any huge reason to run out and grab this again unless A. It’s never been played before B. Love to collect or purchase anything with Resident Evil in the title, or C. Just simply want to replay it again on the new consoles. There’s nothing really wrong with the game as far as coming over to the PS4, and mileage will vary on the repeated issues the game does have, like handheld design roots, scope, and limited animations. Though I will say, getting this for $19.99 is a solid deal, and I’ll be taking choice B in adding this to my collection as I’m a long time Resident Evil fan.",80

12103,188,2003,10,"Overall, for $19.99, it’s a bargain to play a solid entry in the Resident Evil series in HD with a solid framerate.

At this point, I would even take a Remastered or Remade Re: Outbreak, which was a game well ahead of its time.",75
12104,427,2003,10,"At the end of the day, I would rather play Resident Evil: Revelations again on current-gen consoles than to reminisce about my 3DS. It didn't hold up well, and it understandably suffers in many graphical areas due to it having been originally developed for a handheld device. It's still a better-than-average game that features a classic series plot and two of my favorite characters. If you go into it with the understanding that this is a port of a handheld game, you should be more than pleased with it. The Raid mode extends playability and longevity with its addicting gameplay and co-op capabilities. Luckily, the comes with a wallet-friendly price of $20, but if you can catch it on sale, it's an even better deal.",75

The exception would be those who really loved Raid, as the new Chaos mode might prove reason enough to revisit. Instead, this is probably best suited to those who’ve never played Revelations before, or who came to Resident Evil off the back of Resi 7 and are curious about the series’ history.

12128,74,2003,18,"With Resident Evil 7: Biohazard suggesting that the main entry games are again pivoting in a new direction, Capcom's re-rerelease of Revelations may be its way of showing fans that it's also committed to the ""classic"" Resident Evil formula with this side series. While the visuals have aged considerably in the short timeframe, the classic Resident Evil gameplay and feel is still there, complete with a bonkers B-grade storyline. I’d dare say that most Resident Evil fans have possibly found a way to have played this already, and there is really no incentive to come back for another round.",70

It's definitely worth your time.",85

However, because it is this game's third incarnation on a Nintendo system, whether or not to purchase Resident Evil: Revelations will all come down to whether one wants to play it again, or whether or not it is their very first time. First-time players should not hesitate, as this is probably the best way to play this game - ever! Potential double- or even triple-dippers should simply consider what they are looking for. It is likely that the online mode won't be supported much longer on the older systems, and the Switch allows you to play it in the best conditions, save for the lack of means of communication with people met inside the game. Nothing can be taken away from how good the RAID mode is, though, so those who can't help but want more of it on the newest system shouldn't have any reasons to feel ashamed of themselves. It's a blast to blast oozes into oblivion.",90

The campaign does a great job of keeping the player on the edge of their seat, the Raid Mode is a fun bonus and a blast to play through, and the new motion controls feel very intuitive in handheld mode. The fact that it's an HD remaster of a 3DS game does hold it back a little, with inconsistent graphics and frequent loading rooms - but all in all it still feels great to play. Whether you've experienced it before or it's your first time playing, Resident Evil Revelations is a superb action/horror title that is worth exploring.",85

12163,280,2003,6,"As a re-release/remaster, it certainly helps that Resident Evil: Revelations was a good game from the moment it first launched on 3DS, however time has done very little to erode that fact. Yes, there are certainly moments where Revelations‘ origins as a 2012 portable game become apparent due to some muddy textures or occasional design choices, but those are some slight bumps in what is otherwise good to strong visual and gameplay design. Some other issues, like occasionally questionable voice acting and overwrought storytelling, are effectively mainstays of the series, at this point. The game is at its best when it focuses on a sense of isolation and mystery against oppressing odds, and while it occasionally deviates from this focus with more action-packed vignettes, most of the game is spent embracing this. Furthermore, the game’s structure, built on relatively short chapter segments, as well its raid mode, were clearly designed around the fact that it was originally a portable game, so this translates perfectly to Switch’s portable mode. As an added bonus, playing the game handheld with the smaller, lower resolution screen also helps cover up some of the visual imperfections. So, while this version of the game might not redefine the overall experience, its portability and added motion controls for aiming may very well make it the best version yet, thus making it easy to recommend to die-hard fans as well as those yet to make the plunge.",83

12204,279,2003,1,"Despite these few setbacks, however, Resident Evil: Revelations is an impressive game that's great fun. Though its contribution to the larger mythos is inconsequential, the game's story mode presents a good challenge and some genuinely hair-raising moments, and Raid Mode is fun, addictive, and rewarding.",90
12205,63,2003,1,"Resident Evil: Revelations is a great return to form for the Resident Evil franchise and a wonderful start to 2012 in terms of gaming, if you're looking for something to play on your 3DS or something to play in general, do not hesitate to pick this up.",90
12206,268,2003,1,"Revelations deserves to be a full, numbered iteration in the series, in recognition of the excellent (and important) part it plays in filling in the Resident Evil story. It's every bit a fully-blown Resident Evil game and is absolutely worthy of a place in any fan's collection.",90
12207,264,2003,1,"One of the best Resident Evil games in recent years, Capcom have outdone themselves setting a new benchmark for the series which all future releases should follow; Revelations is a Resi revolution and one that you should be part of.",90
12208,124,2003,1,"While some kinks still need to be ironed out, like the off-balanced narrative and some weak moments in the campaign, the game remains one of the best experiences you can find on the system, and rises as the most impressive technical achievement we've seen on Nintendo's 3D handheld so far.",90
12209,415,2003,1,"Revelations is definitely one of the best games for the Nintendo 3DS to date: It offers great action, a very good story, outstanding graphics and a great atmosphere with lots of shocking moments.",88
12210,195,2003,1,"If gunning down zombies in a gorgeous survivor horror world sounds like your idea of a fun portable adventure, I'd say give this one a look. At the very least you owe it to yourself to check out the demo to get an idea of just what Capcom is offering this time around.",88
12211,70,2003,1,"Overall, it's one of the best portable survival horror titles I've played in a while-even if it's not all survival horror.",87
12212,41,2003,1,"The story is one of the best in Resident Evil's recent history, and the shooter controls are pretty much perfect.",86
12213,193,2003,1,"The versatile gameplay, muscular pacing, and addictive Raid mode make it one of the most well-rounded entries in the series.",86
12214,213,2003,1,"A great handheld game, one that not only pushes the boundaries and standards of the Nintendo 3DS but one that recaptures a long-forgotten spirit of a classic franchise. Make no mistake about it, this is a full Resident Evil adventure that isn't watered down because it's in portable form.",85
12215,408,2003,1,"Resident Evil Revelations mixes action with adventure, partially returning to the origins of the series. It is a must-have for console owners, and one of the pinnacles of visual quality we've seen so far in the Nintendo 3DS. It also has a very good story which will please fans of the saga eager to know more about Umbrella, zombies, an the STARS team.",85
12216,140,2003,1,Revelations is a successful blend of old-school Resident Evil horror and new-school action.,85
12217,365,2003,1,"Resident Evil Revelations is a must-have for all Resident Evil fans and everyone who have a Nintendo 3DS. Despite many positive features, however, the game fails to frighten the player.",85
12218,89,2003,1,"Resident Evil Revelations is a quite accomplished mixture of the series' most reknown titles. Borrowing something from the first episode, others from the latest, it succeeds in creating a new formula, appealing to both the new and old fans of the franchise. The game's structure has some minor flaws, but its value is undeniable.",85
12219,111,2003,1,"I'm not sure I'd buy a 3DS just for Revelations. It's not a system seller, but it's a good, solid third-party title. As an installment in the larger series, it's an interesting and hopeful glimpse of where Resident Evil is going now.",85
12220,280,2003,1,"On the controls front, however, Revelations is a much more pleasing sight, particularly without the newly released Circle Pad Pro peripheral.",83
12221,376,2003,1,"While Revelation's campaign is a fresh take on familiar tropes, its biggest surprise is Raid Mode, a madcap remixing of elements from the main campaign.",83
12222,404,2003,1,"Revelations is not a milestone in the series, is not brilliant, but it is very competent, both technically and conceptually, and has something that the series is really needed: personality. This is the time to Resident Evil stop and think where to go. Revelations is a step in the right direction. One single step.",83
12223,262,2003,1,"Revelations is a great technical achievement on the 3DS, and a competent and enjoyable product overall. It's a shame that the unacceptable enemy AI makes the experience much less thrilling that what could have been; but given the fact that it's on a portable console, you can easily forgive Capcom once more.",82
12224,5,2003,1,"On one hand you have the atmospheric stages on board the Queen Zenobia with constant changes between horror and terror elements. Unfortunately in latter levels the classic formula mutates to a simple action game that is average at best, even though visually Revelations is easily one of the most impressive games on the 3DS.",81
12225,82,2003,1,"Resident Evil: Revelations is gorgeous, huge, and offers the most fully-featured online co-op experience on 3DS. The single-player isn't quite the survival horror comeback Capcom promised but, with its brilliant take on score attack, Raid mode ensures Revelations delivers at least once on its title.",80
12226,257,2003,1,"The best Resident Evil since number 4 and that's despite a number of compromises in the story mode, but very much helped by the superb graphics and online mode.",80
12227,425,2003,1,"So I forget what happened. The important thing is, Resident Evil Revelations is a kickass action game. It follows in the footsteps of Resident Evil 5, ditching the plodding ""survive against insurmountable odds"" gameplay of the early games in the series and going straight to ""make zombies explode into a pile of goo with a machine gun."" This is the first game I've played on 3DS that really pushes the hardware - if you want a 3-D graphical showpiece for your new console, this will be the game you brag to your friends about.",80
12228,202,2003,1,"Revelations remains as resolutely rock hard to play as ever, with an emphasis on slow forward motion that makes the 3DS's spongy analogue pad feel all the more frustrating.",80
12229,332,874,13,"A rag-doll requiem of destruction, so gratuitous that it defies moral probity. Like all the best shock and awe titles, the vice is polished so sweetly you'll barely notice you've gone to hell. [Apr 2008, p.105]",90

12233,174,874,13,FlatOut: Head On gives you a lot of enjoyable racing for a portable game.,85
12234,232,874,13,"Yes, technically it’s a port of FlatOut 2, and a pretty belated one at that, but just because it’s the least visually impressive version of the game doesn’t make it the least technically accomplished.",81

12236,147,874,13,It’s hard not to love a title that piles on all the game modes (including multiplayer) and makes the racing element actually fun.,80
12237,318,874,13,"If you enjoy a taste of destruction and dirty moves in your races, then Head On is the perfect choice.",80
12238,427,874,13,"Aside from the races in FlatOut mode, FlatOut: Head On is one of the most genuinely fun and entertaining racers I've picked up in a long time.",80
12239,324,874,13,"Top visuals, and some lovely particle effects create the illusion of a triple-A title. [Issue#164, p.95]",79

12241,1,874,13,FlatOut is fun and different enough that it manages to stand out.,75
12242,140,874,13,"FlatOut: Head On follows the same basic formula as the rest of the series, but the PlayStation Portable version is the current definitive package.",75
12243,110,874,13,"FlatOut manages to plow through wrecked cars and almost anything else in its way, but this problem remains as a last obstacle. [May 2008, p.99]",75
12244,313,874,13,"If you like the idea of sending a small man through a windscreen in to a giant dartboard, this is worth a look. [Apr 2008, p.82]",70
12245,293,874,13,"FlatOut: Head On basically takes FlatOut 2 and tweaks a few things, resulting in a solid game, with plenty of content. The racing isn't quite as good this time around, but the Carnage mode is pretty decent.",70
12246,152,874,13,"A fun, cheeky, crash-tastic ride to the finish line.",70
12247,160,874,13,"FlatOut Head On has some minor problems just like its big brother on the Xbox 360. Although the conversion to the handheld is a success, the game has some issues when it comes to framerate and unpredictable physics. The gameplay compared to FlatOut Ultimate Carnage stays the same and on top of that the game has variation and good visuals to make it even more attractive.",70
12248,314,874,13,FlatOut finds its natural home on PSP where the speedy events and abusing your driver gag don't outstay their welcome as much as on PlayStation 2. An instant pick-up-and-play winner.,70
12249,151,874,13,"FlatOut is a mix of the extreme racing seen in the Burnout series combined with the crazy stunts that you would see in Jackass. It's different, and offers something for both the speed freaks and crash-n-burn junkies.",70
12250,316,874,13,"The controls start out accessible, but get a bit nutty with the faster cars, but if you can get used to them then you should find yourself enjoying the $20 you spent on this one.",70
12251,323,874,13,"Flatout: Head On may not contain guns, but who needs guns when you get plenty of explosive destruction by simply crashing your ride into oblivion. [May 2008, p.65]",70
12252,268,874,13,"Technically the title is extremely impressive too, so if you're looking for a title to sell PSPs to your friends, this might do it.",65
12253,82,874,13,"The overriding feeling is that Head On belongs on more powerful consoles. Without the added bells and whistles, its core racing mechanics and their shortcomings are bare, obvious, and will struggle in a genre that is stacked to the rafters on PSP.",60
12254,41,874,13,"A fun little arcade racer that will be a fun diversion for a few hours, but the novelty is likely to wear off quickly.",60
12255,9,874,13,"FlatOut: Head On looks a bit like a nice slice of cake, but in reality it's more of a biscuit. It's not even a particularly pleasant biscuit, either; the first bite or two is nice enough, but after an hour or so you'll begin to taste the bitter unfairness of the AI, or the stale mini-games, or the… well, you get the idea.",60
12256,192,874,13,"What has four wheels, bad music, and lackluster graphics? Flatout: Head On! Save your money for one of the console version where this game can be better appreciated.",42
12257,445,2944,8,"It is fast-paced, long, challenging, and beautiful to look at. The minor flaws with it are easily overlooked when one considers the whole package and realizes that this is probably the best X-Men game to appear on a console in the past ten years or so.",92
12258,420,2944,8,"Do you have a buddy that wants to play with ya, also? Simple and easy to get him in. You don't have to have him restart with a gimpy character. You can just have him plug in his controller and join in with you, then just unplug it when he is done. This rocked.",91
12259,187,2944,8,"All in all, this is a really simple gauntlet style title, but it’s a good one, and worth playing with three of your friends.",91
12260,45,2944,8,"The beat ‘em up is a genre that has quietly faded to the side and hasn’t had many revolutions on the consoles in recent years.

12261,132,2944,8,"Stellar cell-shaded graphics, excellent voice acting (with Patrick Stewart reprising his cinematic role as Professor X), and multiplayer mayhem that make Legends look and feel like the A-list game that it is.",90
12262,110,2944,8,"With over 20 hours of gameplay, and one of the most enjoyable cooperative multiplayer experiences I've had, I couldn't recommend Legends more highly to fans and newbies alike. [Nov 2004, p.144]",90
12263,51,2944,8,Successfully combines action and RPG elements; Easy controls and simple game play; Great use of X-Men license that will please fans of the comic.,90
12264,142,2944,8,The thing that immediately struck me when playing the game was the amazing amount of minutiae that's been included for eagle-eyed fans.,90
12265,147,2944,8,"Creates a thoroughly enjoyable atmosphere, with great multiplayer options. Marvel fans can rejoice, and fans of team-based combat games can as well.",90
12266,369,2944,8,The best game set in the X-Men universe yet.,90
12267,174,2944,8,X-Men fans rejoice! There’s finally a game worthy of your devotion.,88
12268,419,2944,8,"A must own for the fans, and definitely worth at least a rental from casual gamers. Be warned though, with its sprawling story, if you get hooked on this game be prepared to play it for a while – it’s a long title that will definitely make you feel like you got your money’s worth.",88
12269,271,2944,8,The action-RPG element really gave Raven Soft the ability to expand on the characters and give you more control than you've ever had with them.,86
12270,195,2944,8,It is steeped in the history of the X-Men comic books and is an easy game to just pick up and play.,85
12271,3,2944,8,"To reinforce the notion that the game is based on the comic series, a cel shading style has been used for the graphics and it looks great even on the PS2.",85
12272,450,2944,8,"There are some AI issues, and the multiplayer component seems like it was tacked on as an afterthought, but, as a total package, Legends delivers. It is as true to the source material as any game could hope to be, and as a long-time fan of the X-Men, I am more than pleased.",85
12273,307,2944,8,"A surprisingly natural, action-RPG that remains fun to play through during its length.",84
12274,213,2944,8,"The fighting is simple, addictive, and enjoyable throughout the long adventure. It's nice to see the X-Men get their due with a game that truly showcases what has made the comics great for three decades.",84
12275,188,2944,8,What probably makes this game so interesting as an action game though is the ability to play up to four players cooperatively. Even better is how seamless they make this experience.,83
12276,111,2944,8,"Even with the technical snafus that sometimes plague Legends, this is still the best X-Men title ever produced. The Action/RPG elements are nicely integrated within an epic storyline with plenty of intrigue and a huge amount of gameplay that can take 20 hours or more to fully complete.",83
12277,227,2944,8,"Does away with swords and sorcery, and instead gives us an excellent action RPG populated by Marvel Comics' band of heroic mutants.",82
12278,140,2944,8,"Packs in a good number of different playable characters and great-looking graphics into an easy, but fairly lengthy adventure. It all combines to form a great action RPG with strong action and a well-told story.",82
12279,348,2944,8,"Although it's certainly not genre busting in any way, it provides Action-RPG fans something better to play than the subpar ""Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel."" Anyone who is a fan of either the X-Men or Action-RPGs will find a fun, 15-hour game with X-Men Legends.",81
12280,136,2944,8,"One thing to keep in mind though is that this is indeed an RPG. Although it may not seem like one, it is and the games length reveals that very well. You will need to stick with the game for some time until you start to see the real fun start to shine through.",80
12281,1,2944,8,"If an absolutely brilliant story, finely detailed characterization, and faultless attention to canonical detail are what you're after, then, X-Men Legends is not what you're looking for. If you want a good game, though, and an especially good game to play with a couch full of superhero fans, this is the game to get.",80
12282,288,2944,8,"On its own merits, XML is a solid action-RPG, but as an X-Men game, it's a superb representation of the mythos. [Dec 2004, p.112]",80

12285,105,2944,8,"The love that went into it shines through, and it's enough to have True Believers shouting ""Excelsior!"" for weeks to come. [Dec 2004, p.117]",80
12286,395,2944,8,"If you have a couple friends and an afternoon to charge through the game with them, you're going to have a blast. The single-player experience is still fun, but without the lure of real teamwork, the rougher spots of the game tend to punch through to the fore during inopportune times.",80
12287,263,2944,8,"Super hero games have a particularly bad reputation among most gamers. For every rare decent licensed game there are always a slew along the lines of the abysmal Aquaman Now that I’ve succeeded in sending shivers down your spine, I am pleased to announce that X-Men Legends most definitely does not suck.",78
12288,62,2944,8,"Good for fans, but action-RPG gamers probably already have a better game in hand.",78
12289,394,2944,8,The combat system has a depth that allows you to learn new moves and string together long combos for some slick fighting while the vivid comic book style goes some way to explain the occasionally basic look of some of the sections.,77
12290,150,2944,8,"The environments are expansive and varied, and you can interact (read: destroy) virtually anything you come across. The cel-shading effect is put to good use here.",75
12291,311,2944,8,"The camera is a frequent problem and some of the battles and level designs are unbalanced, but these feel just like classic X-Men battles. [Holiday 2004, p.82]",75
12292,80,2944,8,"Despite recycled levels, repetitive enemies, chaotic combat, and unbalanced characters, just controlling four X-Men and using their powers is usually enough to make up for Legends' flaws. [Holiday 2004, p.100]",75
12293,120,2944,8,Easily the best of the X-Men games to ever appear on a console and a shining example that not all games based on licensed properties like comics and movies have to suck.,75
12294,115,2944,8,The developers took a bit of a short cut by relying on invisible walls to guide you through each level.,75
12295,393,2944,8,"The game does have quite an ‘old-school’ feel to it that some may not like, but it’s a definite foundation for the franchise to develop over time.",70
12296,50,2944,8,"It's rare that an action role-playing game works as both an 'action' and 'role-playing' game, so to come across such slick combat and a deeply involving character upgrade system here is a real treat.",70
12297,317,2944,8,"Light on story and depth but packed with tons of action (particularly in multiplayer), Legends is an X-Men fan’s dream come true and the best non-fighting game ever made featuring Marvel’s legendary team of superheroes.",70
12298,323,2944,8,"There's no denying that the level of interaction in here is humbling. [Nov 2004, p.54]",67
12299,453,2944,8,"The AI-controlled team mates are shockingly ineffective. They have the power; they have the abilities. Why can’t they take matters into their own hands more often, then?",62
12300,99,2944,8,The overhead camera feels constrained. We simply want an isometric view to get a better perspective.,60
12301,451,2944,8,"It’s far from perfect, but Marvel fans have been served well, and those who like their Gauntlet served with extra statistics will have a game they can place just behind the last Dark Alliance. [Dec 2004, p.109]",60
12302,235,2944,8,"The not-so-obvious story, sound and graphics take away from this excellent game. The game is definitely an experience worth trying, but don’t expect a long ride!",60
12303,186,2944,8,Shame then that the actual game itself does not contain much inspiration to match the source material.,60
12304,162,2944,8,How is it possible to make a tedious game about the adventures of heroic mutants with super powers?,20
12305,79,2944,16,One of the best comic games to come along in years … and it's certainly the best X-Men game I've ever played.,95

12319,108,2944,16,"The fast button-pounding gameplay mixed with the strategy of stat-building and item-management makes this game fit in everyone's favorite category. Group this with a fantastic storyline, good voice acting and the addition of several multiplayer modes and you've got one of the best comic book games ever made.",90

12535,67,2044,13,"Even with downloadable content, it’s hard to compete with the staying power of the console versions, mainly because it removes a group from the equation.

12536,82,2044,13,"A lovely-looking, unique and tightly designed rhythm-action game built of equal parts FreQuency and Rock Band. The track selection's good, it's far from a lazy port, and its similarity to Harmonix games past makes playing it an unexpectedly nostalgic pleasure.",80
12537,255,2044,13,"If you're looking to enjoy with a fun game, this is your choice. Harmonix has done a very good job an recreating the feeling of the original Rock Band into this PSP version. We've like 40 songs, with hundreds of different combinations for players to change the way they play.",80

12546,124,2044,13,"Looking at Rock Band Unplugged as a music game, it is absolutely incredible. Looking at it as a Rock Band title, it feels like it could have been so much more. You will certainly get a lot of joy and challenge playing through the game on your own, but when you will be craving some interaction with friends, you will return to the console versions.",79
12547,316,2044,13,"If you don't mind playing a game with only your fingers, I suppose you could give Rock Band Unplugged a chance. But for a game with minimal downloadable content, no multiplayer, a playlist and World Tour experience that is largely identical to the console games, and little to no innovation...$40 is not quite the ticket I'd be willing to pay.",75
12548,178,2044,13,"A good rhythm game that definitely exceeded my expectations. It’s fun and addictive, with plenty of venues, and though I would have liked to see less repetition in the tracklist, I still found myself saying “Just one more song” repeatedly.",75
12549,136,2044,13,"As a way of taking the four player Rock Band experience and distilling it down into a portable, instrument-free experience, the game excels, it's just that I don't want my Rock Band experience to be instrument free.",75
12550,333,2044,13,"Vague disappointments aside, Rock Band Unplugged offers a clever portable twist on the music game formula that is mostly engrossing and fun...even if it can be damned frustrating. [July 2009, p.84]",70
12551,160,2044,13,"Rock Band Unplugged brings the gameplay we know and love from the consoles to the PSP. The control feels very natural on the portable system and the soundtrack is impressive. However, Unplugged doesn't offer many new songs and the lack of multiplayer is a missed opportunity.",70

12553,153,2044,13,"The portable version of Rock Band utilizes some great ideas and is both addictive and fun to play. It's a shame that the game lacks multiplayer functionality. But it's still worth your money, and a great addition to the rather limited offerings on the PSP.",70
12554,242,2044,13,"As a translation of a peripheral based game to a button based portable game this is without a doubt a great experience. The concept of playing different instruments in sections to clear the tracks actually works really well and the formula in the stationary Rock Band games has been well translated to the portable format. If you're looking for a portable rhythm based music game on the PSP this is definitely a recommended purchase. There are some stains on the canvas though: only 41 tracks, no multiplayer and no interoperability with the PS3.",70

12707,408,2180,7,"Despite its flaws, we have to say we have a more than decent title here, heir to a legacy of classic survival horror elements and an example of what Silent Hill should be in this generation.

12709,240,2180,7,"New installment to the popular horror series surprisingly discourages the gamers by an extremely slow opening. Those who get over the first few boring hours will be rewarded greatly — music, atmosphere, puzzles, boss fights are fantastic as usual. [Feb 2009]",70
12710,143,2180,7,"The fifth episode of the series is shocking PC gamers - with long distances to cover and stupid riddles to solve. It still has some well done horror moments to offer, but it's not as creepy as the earlier episodes. A lot of effects were just copied over, so instead of being scary they cause the feeling of ""been there, done that"".",69

12712,110,2180,7,"Fans will probably dig the game’s cool set pieces and the story, but the save points are placed too far apart, many puzzles require too much random experimentation, and the dialogue system seems like an afterthought. [Nov 2008, p.118]",65
12713,228,2180,7,"This action game with horror influences made us scream at night. The music and spooky enemies has driven us to a point that we had to switch on all the lights. Once we weren’t scared anymore we saw some things that made are eyebrows go up. The protagonist, Alex, can fight and uses a gun. This takes away a lot of fun that we had during the last Silent Hill. So it is safe to say that it’s a good game, but doesn’t have the ‘wow’ factor.",65

12785,229,225,16,What Black does do right is the fact that you are almost guaranteed to not find another game this action intense in a long time. I've never played a FPS with this much going on and stuff flying around on the screen.,83

12839,436,1036,17,"On the one hand, it's a great adventure game and yes certain areas could have been polished. The problem is that they only enhanced the graphics and the audio a bit for the 360 version. In other words, for those who already own it for the Xbox system, aside from enhanced graphics and 360 acievements there isn't much of a difference.",84
12840,136,1036,17,"The gameplay mechanics in Gun are a lot of fun, and can be picked up and learned pretty easily with a little tiny bit of practice.",83
12841,174,1036,17,"I sincerely hope that Gun does well enough to warrant a Gun 2, and that the sequel really fills out the gameplay and lets it truly live up to its full potential.",82
12842,232,1036,17,"Even though it has open-ended free roaming aspects, it feels far more like a short linear game supplemented by hidden areas and bonus missions.",81
12843,21,1036,17,"The gameplay's neither terribly exciting nor really unique in the world of action games, and what uniqueness we get from the setting is about all it really has (other than the core story which happens to be pretty damn good).",81
12844,142,1036,17,"You'll likely be so enthralled by the riveting story that you simply won't notice the hours flying by. Of course, that's also due in no small part to the fact that the game is unsatisfyingly short.",80
12845,41,1036,17,"Gun is a darn good Western and really the only action title of its kind available for the Xbox 360, but since its already available on current gen consoles I wouldn't purchase a new system to play it.",80
12846,164,1036,17,"The Xbox 360 version does benefit from being graphically better than its previous cousins, and, as a result, it's the best version out there, providing an experience that absolutely, positively nails the Wild West as it's supposed to be.",80
12847,450,1036,17,"One of the best action games to come along in recent memory. It’s unfortunate that the experience ends so quickly, but few games twice as long leave behind such a lasting impression as remains after completing this adventure in the Old West.",80

12853,184,1036,17,"If there's a nit to pick with Gun, it's that it's short. Depending on how much you poke around, you can beat it in anywhere from six to ten hours. To us, that's no problem; we'll take a short amazing game over a long lackluster one any day.",80
12854,193,1036,17,"Are you a fan of westerns? If so, there’s no reason not to grab Gun while you wait for the next round of 360 titles to hit, but it’s so short and offers little replay value so a rental is probably in your best fiscal interests.",80

12856,147,1036,17,"After playing through it once, I was left feeling a little disappointed. GUN is still a fun adventure, but lacks in some elements that could have made it a real hit.",79

12859,115,1036,17,"A solid game that, on all platforms, performs admirably, draws you into the story, takes itself (and you) seriously, and does the genre proud. It's too thin around the waist to really tangle with the big boys.",75
12860,371,1036,17,"A must-rent because of its enjoyable campaign, but I’m afraid that’s all, due to its major deficiency in replay value.",75

12866,80,1036,17,"The majority of the game is one long gunfight, shifting between a traditional free-looking aim to lock-on, slow-mo shooting. It's good stuff, if you don't mind your foes acting like targets in a carnival game.",72
12867,321,1036,17,"This really is how a Western shooter is supposed to be made, the players at Neversoft have shown that they can do more than skateboarding games. This is a mature rated game and rightly so, you’ll see buckets of blood and even though the graphics are nothing out of this world for this console the game is still a decent launch title for any 360 owner.",72

12872,150,1036,17,"On its own merits, it is hard to justify paying $60 to buy Gun. It is a solid game, but when you can have essentially the same experience on Xbox for less money, I do not see the point in buying it for the Xbox 360.",70
12873,158,1036,17,"With no multiplayer modes and a barely noticeable graphical upgrade, the only upside to owning GUN for 360 as opposed to any other current-gen platform are the ‘accomplishments’—unlockable rewards that contribute to your Xbox Live account’s Gamerscore.",69
12874,188,1036,17,"It's disappointing to be sure, because when you get right down to it, this could be an absolutely excellent game. With better graphics and a tad longer story this game might have been a contender game of the year in some category or another.",67
12875,140,1036,17,"On the Xbox 360, this short Old West action adventure feels old all right. And its fairly fun shooting action is dragged down by a slapdash presentation.",64
12876,393,1036,17,"Whilst the production values of GUN are high in every possible way, it's let down by a short campaign and an overly structured dynamic of side-missions. The truth is that for a game that should have been GTA: Wild West it's far too restrictive an experience and one that will disappoint those expecting it to deliver wholeheartedly.",60
12877,82,1036,17,"The setting lends itself perfectly to the premise, yet ultimately the overly forgiving combat system makes the game too damned easy.",60
12878,433,1036,17,"Visually it is probably one of the worst, if not the worst looking game on Xbox 360, and the extra ten you pay for it is a clear sign to stay away from this game.",60

12885,30,1036,7,"A no-holds-barred, straight up western that certainly deserves a good look. The major flaw is how quick it is to finish and how easy it is to complete 100% of the tasks the game has to offer.",86
12886,271,1036,7,"What it does lack is a good multiplayer element. That makes the game seem ""done"" once you beat it. It isn't a short game to beat, but after you're done there's no online play to make you go back to it.",83

12964,249,1036,16,The freedom to roam and undertake missions works well and the story is gripping and entertaining at the same time.,85
12965,147,1036,16,"Is GUN the definitive Western game? No. But it is darn good, and fun to play. The action is well paced, the story is very well done, the game looks great and the audio is a definite treat.",84
12966,174,1036,16,Roaming free is just not exciting as it should be as there is not really anything to do outside of beating on the poor townsfolk.,83
12967,193,1036,16,"Gun is fun, but the short length, ease of gameplay and lack of those little extras really hurt replayability – and that's a shame because otherwise, this is a great game.",83
12968,271,1036,16,"What it does lack is a good multiplayer element. That makes the game seem ""done"" once you beat it. It isn't a short game to beat, but after you're done there's no online play to make you go back to it.",83
12969,229,1036,16,"Graphically, Gun is one of those games that looks great for the most part, but does have a few rough edges that keep it from being in the same class as, say, ""Resident Evil 4"" or ""Ninja Gaiden.""",83
12970,232,1036,16,"At least if you do take in everything the game has to offer on the first sitting, you'll easily feel like you've had a fulfilling experience, but unlike a GTA game, it's pretty unlikely that you'll come back for more once you've finished.",81
12971,389,1036,16,A fast-moving experience that will be quickly finished by even the most novice gamers. I was able to get through the game in about seven hours and that's including the time I spent on side-quests (several completed to 100%).,80
12972,63,1036,16,"Calling this shooter a GTA in a Wild West setting would not do it justice, as it serves up a thrilling experience with an engaging story and solid combat.",80
12973,1,1036,16,"The interesting thing about Gun, however, is that it mixes broad free-roaming aspects with some of the most tightly scripted missions we've seen in any game -- quite an achievement for an original game from a company known for skateboarding titles.",80
12974,323,1036,16,"The big surprise comes from the strength of the narrative, which crackles with snappy dialogue and characters that show real emotion. [Jan 2006, p.47]",80
12975,213,1036,16,"One the one hand you've got a rich and compelling narrative, a twitch-happy gun mechanic, and a big landscape in which to explore. On the other hand, the controls are loose and a little sloppy, the targeting perimeter around each character is way too big and forgiving, so it's easy to be a bad shooter, and the vast landscape doesn't have much in it.",80
12976,41,1036,16,Gun has a great story and it's presented with panache.,80
12977,117,1036,16,"An ambitious, brutal, slice of Americana with a great look, great story, and some great experiences to be had but, frustratingly, it doesn't all add up to overall greatness.",80
12978,427,1036,16,"A fantastic-looking, smooth-playing, slickly-developed, adult-themed Wild, Wild West action game, which succeeds in most every area it enters.",80
12979,431,1036,16,One of the strongest aspects of the game is the outstanding story.,80
12980,439,1036,16,"The perfect consumable for those seeking some ""Deadwood""-esque action. It's lewd, crude and, well, something that rhymes with those two words.",80
12981,142,1036,16,"Thanks to one of the best storylines we've seen in quite a while (as well as a heaping helping of good old-fashioned violence), Gun isn't a gaming experience that we'll soon forget.",80
12982,3,1036,16,The character models are incredibly detailed and again carry across the Western theme very well. The draw distance is miles and miles.,80
12983,164,1036,16,"Gun is a blazingly original game that's made with guts and pride, booming with an intense storyline and booming with all sorts of amazing content.",80
12984,372,1036,16,"It's tough to recommend GUN at its full sticker price for what it is, and that is an excellently told, eight-hour story wrapped up in the guise of an action videogame masquerading as a Western.",78
12985,94,1036,16,"Graphically Gun is as pretty as a peach. The motions of both man and beast are well captured and even close up, they look beautifully textured, very tangible.",78
12986,371,1036,16,"The main problem with GUN is its lack of multiplayer. The campaign is a fun-filled occurrence, but after you finish it in a few hours you'll be wishing you didn't drop fifty down for it.",78
12987,189,1036,16,"It has great presentation; fantastic voice work; fun gun- and horseplay; and a free-roaming world that lets you do almost anything you want. However, even with all these great elements, it's too short to enjoy it all.",76
12988,433,1036,16,The storyline grows stale by the end of the game but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable... It's a great purchase.,75
12989,115,1036,16,"A solid game that, on all platforms, performs admirably, draws you into the story, takes itself (and you) seriously, and does the genre proud. It's too thin around the waist to really tangle with the big boys.",75
12990,140,1036,16,"The experience just doesn't last long enough to be savored. Gun's main story missions are exciting, but the main plot is over so quickly that the whole thing just ends up feeling rushed, and the various side missions aren't compelling enough to hold your interest after the end credits roll.",74
12991,239,1036,16,"Born on the Playstation 2, and it looks it. Muddy Textures, low detail. The large gameworld is technically impressive though.",74
12992,80,1036,16,"The majority of the game is one long gunfight, shifting between a traditional free-looking aim to lock-on, slow-mo shooting. It's good stuff, if you don't mind your foes acting like targets in a carnival game.",72
12993,9,1036,16,It has interesting features and plenty of action and intense shootouts to keep you entertained (especially when you get your grubby hands on the gatling gun) but between these parts you're left wandering around a dull environment with very little to keep you occupied.,70
12994,82,1036,16,"You'll enjoy the gunplay, you'll probably be numbed by the slo-mo gunplay repetition, and then see it through anyway because it's all quite undemanding fun with a decent story. On horseback. Just don't expect Gun to change the world. It really is just ""True Crime in the Wild West.""",70
12995,419,1036,16,"Gun is the best Wild West game to date but it is a low-down dirty shame that developers Neversoft didn't apply the same comprehensive approach to the design work as they did to the soundtrack, voice casting and the plot.",70
12996,192,1036,16,"Gun is a fun little game of Cowboys and Indians worth checking out if you're a fan of this era, but don't expect more than a few hours of gameplay.",70
12997,445,1036,16,"If you want to compare GUN to GTA, it's fair to say that it doesn't reach the level of enjoyment found in the GTA games mainly because the missions push you forward a little too much and you don't get the chance to explore as much as you might want to do.",70
12998,307,1036,13,"Gun Showdown manages to improve on the original in many ways. You get more content (and thus correcting one of the main faults against the game), multiplayer and portable-friendly minigames. The underlying gameplay is still top-notch and the presentation is as well.",90
12999,184,1036,13,"Whether you've saddled up with a previous version of Gun or this is your first time strapping on the six-shooters, this title is not to be missed, as it captures this underrepresented genre like no other game.",90
13000,195,1036,13,"With a compelling storyline, and load times that don’t keep you guessing when you’ll get to play, this is a great mature title in a time period that is often left neglected.",85
13001,91,1036,13,"A little old, a little remixed, but still intensely fun, Gun Showdown is one of the best action shooters available for the PSP and I highly recommend a high noon showdown.",85
13002,19,1036,13,A solid story with accompanying satisfyingly gory and glorified GTA-esque Western gunplay along with added multiplayer and mini-game modes overcome a too-short story mode and just-barely-OK controls as Gun Showdown ride off into the sunset as a quality Western-themed adventure for the PSP.,85
13003,174,1036,13,Despite its control issues and occasional frustrations Gun Showdown is an enjoyable game. It does a good job of creating a classic western lone gunman story and packing it with exciting missions with plenty of action.,83
13004,108,1036,13,"GUN Showdown sets a new standard of wild west action gameplay that merges an epic, and oft-times emotional story with challenging gameplay and realistic horseback riding and mounted combat.",82
13005,41,1036,13,Gun Showdown portrays the Wild Frontier with a realism that was missed in those old Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s and 70s.,82
13006,450,1036,13,"Although controls are clumsy and some technical sacrifices had to be made, the added single player and multiplayer content makes Showdown a much longer-lasting game than its rent-worthy predecessor.",81
13007,213,1036,13,An extremely impressive translation of the game from the console to the PSP. Shooting and western fans will be pleased with the job Activision and Rebellion have done here.,80
13008,123,1036,13,"Developer Rebellion's done splendid work bringing the game to the PSP, though the controls suffer from the default PSP set-up.",80
13009,147,1036,13,"More than just a ho-hum straight port, GUN Showdown offers up a heaping of extras and multiplayer missions that fans of last year’s game would enjoy checking out, as well as those who missed it.",80
13010,63,1036,13,Activision surprises us with a handheld game that offers even more content and features than its console counterparts. An absolute must for Gun fans on the move.,80
13011,259,1036,13,"If you have a fascination with the Old West or even remotely liked last year's release of Gun, then Gun Showdown should be added almost immediately to your game collection. Its gameplay is still riveting and awfully bloody, just the way I like it, and the presentation has been handled well. Grab yourself a dusty hat and hit the trails.",80
13012,31,1036,13,It gets annoying at the end and it isn't a long game by any stretch of the imagination but it works well.,80
13013,9,1036,13,"It is better than the original in terms of content and extras, the controls and graphics are better than many other PSP games and the overall experience is great fun.",80
13014,110,1036,13,"I’m glad Activision tried to address some of the problems in the original game (including adding multiplayer), but Showdown suffers slightly by drifting away from what it had already perfected.",78
13015,325,1036,13,"Gun is simply fun, allowing you to live out all your cowboy fantasies (no, not those ones) and feel like you really are an old west gunslinger.",78
13016,21,1036,13,GUN Showdown is a great game that just doesn't quite fit onto the tiny PSP platform.,78
13017,395,1036,13,"It's not perfect -- not by a long shot -- nor is it without frustrations, but these are inherent problems with the PSP itself for the most part, and one could argue that the game's length is perfectly suited for a handheld. Just be ready to take the good with the bad.",75
13018,66,1036,13,"I must admit I am a sucker for games that tap into my childhood in a positive way. Gun Showdown pointed its barrel at my long lost younger self and told me to reach for the skies. Being a veteran of many gunfights, I did exactly what I was told and haven't regretted a thing.",75
13019,136,1036,13,GUN Showdown proves that with a little ingenuity and some hard work you can create something special for a hand-held platform.,75
13020,140,1036,13,"This updated, portable version of 2006's open-ended Wild West action adventure introduces a few keen changes and features to make up for a few bits that were lost in translation.",74
13021,406,1036,13,A very well put together port of the console version. The story is the main thing that takes the cake here; the extra multiplayer modes are nice but are mostly forgettable.,74
13022,71,1036,13,"Aside from an awkward control system, it’s hard not to appreciate the effort that went into making GUN Showdown more than just a straight port.",72
13023,142,1036,13,"Despite a lot of roaming and only moderately paced action, GUN Showdown's adventure proves unique enough to be entertaining, and the lightning-quick pace of the plot will keep you running from place to place before you have much of a chance to get bored.",70
13024,192,1036,13,"Gun Showdown could have been a disastrous port of a so-so action game, but it ends up being a surprisingly solid game full of fun missions, crazy firefights and some cool extra goodies.",70
13025,334,1036,13,"If you're prepared to come to terms with the sizeable control issues and accept the occasional technical gremlin, there's gold to be found in them there pixels.",70
13026,3,1036,13,"Those new to the franchise will find a truly superb game in GUN, but for anyone coming back for a second helping, chances are you will be disappointed.",70
13027,342,1036,13,"Some more variation and a fuller landscape would have made it perfect. [Jan 2007, p.64]",70
13028,311,1036,13,"This port holds up surprisingly well. [Jan 2007, p.88]",70
13029,427,1036,13,"This version fails to even live up to the console counterpart, as the controls suffer far too much on the PSP itself.",65
13030,313,1036,13,"A port of much style, but little substance. [Feb 2007, p.78]",63
13031,413,1036,13,"There's no denying that GUN Showdown is an entertaining game, but you'll have to overcome the incredibly awkward controls in order to get any enjoyment from it.",60
13032,99,1036,13,"The gun fighting and horse riding action is fun on the go, but the controls take a lot of time to get used to, and the overall game is still rather short.",60
13033,287,1036,13,"The control system is half-cocked making it seem half the experience of the PS2 game. [Christmas 2006, p.86]",60
13034,389,1036,13,"The controls are a bit fuggly, but all in all, it’s the same game that was released for the major consoles, so if you’re really dying to play this, this is a version to consider.",60
13035,179,1036,13,"A once enjoyable wilid west shooter gone bad on the PSP. [Jan 2007, p.69]",59
13036,82,1036,13,"It's GUN on a handheld platform, but it doesn't work quite as well as it does on consoles.",50
13037,293,1036,13,Gun Showdown just goes to show that developers need more than just more content to bring console games to the PSP.,50
13038,145,1036,13,"It’s so frustrating that we’re this far into the PSP’s life cycle and still we get watered down ports of good console games that are all but unplayable. Gun has a lot going for it, but when the interface is broken, the game is broken.",49
13039,307,1036,4,"The core gameplay is very refined and every aspect of the presentation is top-notch. If the game was a bit longer, there really wouldn't be anything to complain about.",93
13040,180,1036,4,"If there's a nit to pick with Gun, it's that it's short. Depending on how much you poke around, you can beat it in anywhere from six to ten hours. To us, that's no problem; we'll take a short amazing game over a long lackluster one any day.",90
13041,111,1036,4,"You're treated to an interesting plot, fun, sandbox-style gameplay, and atmosphere thick enough to choke a horse. It's honestly one of the most fun titles out there, and occasionally so over-the-top as to be downright hilarious.",89
13042,110,1036,4,"Gun surrounds you with characters and a story that put their own stamp on the genre and make you a participant in a grand adventure that stands up to the rich tales of the legendary west. [Dec 2005, p.150]",88
13043,450,1036,4,"One of the best action games to come along in recent memory. It's unfortunate that the experience ends so quickly, but few games twice as long leave behind such a lasting impression as remains after completing this adventure in the Old West.",87
13044,30,1036,4,"A no-holds-barred, straight up western that certainly deserves a good look. The major flaw is how quick it is to finish and how easy it is to complete 100% of the tasks the game has to offer.",86
13045,265,1036,4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Gun, but I came out having a blast. While it's a short ride, beginning to end is an amazing experience.",86
13046,108,1036,4,"The best western action-adventure game to date. With its go-anywhere, shoot/do-anything gameplay, it's like Grand Theft Auto Wild-Wild West style. The graphics are a big disappointment, but the amazing animation, presentation, and sound make up for its downfalls.",85
13047,278,1036,4,"In the end, we just wanted more. More missions, more variety, more drama. [Jan 2006, p.106]",83
13048,195,1036,4,"This is a great game, with a mature storyline and wonderful controls. I did not want this game to end when it did, though the story comes to a very well done close.",83
13049,41,1036,4,Gun has a great story and it's presented with panache.,80
13050,150,1036,4,"There are a lot of good things in this game and I wouldn't be surprised or disappointed to see Neversoft revisit this franchise again, hopefully polishing the rough edges.",80
13051,431,1036,4,One of the strongest aspects of the game is the outstanding story.,80
13052,323,1036,4,"The big surprise comes from the strength of the narrative, which crackles with snappy dialogue and characters that show real emotion. [Jan 2006, p.47]",80

13055,94,1036,4,"Graphically Gun is as pretty as a peach. The motions of both man and beast are well captured and even close up, they look beautifully textured, very tangible.",78
13056,115,1036,4,"Frankly, the Gamecube version of Gun holds up just fine, although it's arguably the most strained in terms of control scheme.",75
13057,140,1036,4,"The experience just doesn't last long enough to be savored. Gun's main story missions are exciting, but the main plot is over so quickly that the whole thing just ends up feeling rushed, and the various side missions aren't compelling enough to hold your interest after the end credits roll.",74
13058,147,1036,4,"Gun, overall, isn't terribly fun to play. But the story is definitely entertaining, the game looks fine, it sounds great, and the Wild West feel is pretty authentic.",72
13059,80,1036,4,"The majority of the game is one long gunfight, shifting between a traditional free-looking aim to lock-on, slow-mo shooting. It's good stuff, if you don't mind your foes acting like targets in a carnival game. [Jan 2006, p.119]",72

13061,419,1036,4,"Gun is a violent, interestingly fulfilling shooter, albeit so brief it doesn't quite do its fantastic premise justice.",70
13062,279,1036,4,"Many of its gameplay mechanics are clearly inspired by the ones found in ""GTA: SA,"" but sadly, Gun doesn't reach that game's overall level of quality, especially in terms of longevity. Even though Gun is very challenging on the harder difficulty settings, it can be beaten in less than ten hours.",70
13063,155,1036,4,Average at best. The great voice acting and the solid graphics are just not enough to keep the game afloat. Somewhat shoddy controls and the lack of depth just drag this title down too much.,63
13064,451,1036,4,"Far too generic to be considered anything other than average. [Christmas 2005, p.114]",50
13065,78,1036,4,"Why roam freely (when the game lets you, which is by no means always) when all that's out there to find is an empty trek between jarring episodes of production-line gaming? [Christmas 2005, p.105]",50
13066,174,580,9,"If you like video games, you will absolutely love Dishonored.",99
13067,328,580,9,"The massive amount of choice given to players keeps the game interesting through multiple replays, proving that multiplayer isn't necessary to be a hit. In a year, and an industry, stricken with a plague known as ""sequelitis"", Dishonored is the perfect cure, and should etch its name into every Game of the Year discussion with a sharply-tipped assassin blade.",95
13068,427,580,9,Dishonored is an easy contender for the best game of the year. It does so much right that it's easy to overlook its few flaws and weaknesses.,95
13069,77,580,9,"Dark, difficult, and deliberately ambiguous, Dishonored asks you to forget much of what you know about the modern blockbuster, tossing flashy gameplay sequences and heavily scripted moments to the wayside in favor of exploration, tension, and eventual triumph over foes who genuinely deserve a knife to the neck.",95
13070,111,580,9,"A lot of imagination, work, and care has gone into it, and your best bet is to slow down, explore it, and see what you can find. It's one of the better games this year, and will probably still be discussed ten or twenty years from now.",95
13071,316,580,9,"The solid story, the fantastic voice performances, the unbelievably well designed city, the attention paid to every small detail, the sheer amount of ridiculously fun skills, and the focus on player creativity is all amazing.",95
13072,120,580,9,"Not only is Dishonored a strong game set in a fascinating universe, it's one of those rare and incredible titles that holds the player's attention right from the start and then leaves them wanting more as the credits roll.",95
13073,313,580,9,"A world of unparalleled potential, married to an Orwellian tale of deception and redemption. Adventures this epic only come along once in a generation. [Dec 2012, p.90]",95
13074,395,580,9,"Well, Arkane, you did what so few games have done this generation: you got me to want to come back to play Dishonored annually. Very, very few games have that honor, but I just can't imagine ever getting tried of Dunwall. What a wonderful game.",95
13075,225,580,9,"Dishonored is the thinking man's first person shooter but throw those guns away as there are so many more interesting ways to take on your enemies. With a great protagonist, interesting characters and well-written story, it's games like Dishonored that really make you sit up and take notice. It's original and gives almost total control to the player on how the story and game will play out. With elements of RPG meets first person shooter, Dishonored is the game to all fans of both these genres and beyond.",93
13076,213,580,9,"Players who really take the time to enjoy the experience are rewarded too. The more runes, bone charms and money you find, the more you can augment and upgrade your character, and the more bad-ass you'll become.",92
13077,324,580,9,"Dishonored basks in artistic brilliance. Dunwall unravels at your feet, reacting organically to your in-game actions in a way that you feel rooted in its rich lore. Stealth has never been so satisfying as it is in Dishonored. One of 2012's finest.",92
13078,188,580,9,"Overall, Dishonored is absolutely worth your time, and provides an excellent stealth focused game that's actually fun to play, as opposed to feeling like a punishing chore.",91
13079,332,580,9,"The buzz Dishonored will give you is unrivalled, and the spontaneous moments of brilliance you'll experience will be unique. It's a wake-up call for first-person gaming, resurrecting long-lost values and casually plunging a knife into the neck of the generic sequel.",90
13080,140,580,9,Dishonored's engrossing world and intoxicating interplay of supernatural powers make it a game you'll want to play more than once.,90
13081,387,580,9,"Perhaps the most striking thing about Dishonored is the way the later stages of the game change, depending on how you've approached earlier missions. If you go through killing everyone and blowing things up, you'll invoke a lot of chaos in the game world and later missions will be darker and more difficult to navigate stealthily.",90
13082,70,580,9,"Dishonored respects its audience by not only trusting them with a myriad of options, but also having the courtesy not to stand in their way. Its gameplay systems are open and intuitive, and reaching their potential feels special in a manner unrealized by any of its contemporaries.",90
13083,329,580,9,"A game full of options, Dishonored puts choice in the hands of the player in nearly every element--gameplay, level progression, even storytelling. Dishonored is one of the greatest new IPs in recent history, and one of the best games of the year.",90
13084,345,580,9,"Dishonored probably could have done a little more with its narrative – but that shouldn't detract from its otherwise incredible achievements. The ability to elect different play styles is not merely a bullet-point here; it's the purpose of the entire game. And while you might not fall in love with the title immediately, allow Dunwall's rat-infested suburbs to crawl beneath your skin, and you'll eventually succumb to its charms like a plague.",90
13085,389,580,9,"Dishonored may not contain the depth of Skyrim or the unrivaled beauty of Uncharted, but it does present something new, innovative and engaging. It makes the player think about the effect their choices, both in terms of narrative and gameplay, may potentially have on the world around them.",90
13086,186,580,9,"A simple story, that is enjoyable and well told, is mixed perfectly with great gameplay. The difficulty levels are spot on, and despite some saying the game is too short, it must be remembered that the story can be played through multiple times, using different methods with each go. Add to this all of the little touches to be found, that are simply too numerous to list, and this is a game where the effort really shows. Dishonored is a must play, and is up there as one of the best games this year.",90
13087,326,580,9,"We can't say why Dishonored exceeds all expectations in a few sentences. Just buy it and lose yourself into the city of Dunwall, the most interesting videogame setting since BioShock's Rapture.",90
13088,58,580,9,"It is a major accomplishment and for all its ambition it succeeds where it counts, by transporting you to a world and empowering you to do with it you wish, creating unscripted and unexpected moments that feel unique to you. It is at these times that it becomes more than just an enjoyable stealth action game, but something truly special.",90
13089,286,580,9,"You can combine Corvos weapons and superpowers in an almost infinite of ways, which can result in some pretty satisfying outcomes. Throw a proximity mine, called a spring razor, on a rat. Then take possession of the rat and walk up to the nearest guard. Then watch the limbs fly. [November 2012, p.66]",90
13090,110,580,9,"The steampunk-inspired technology is fascinating, and the art direction superbly establishes a distinct visual style to accompany the dark and disturbing lore lurking behind the city. I hope this isn't the last time I play a game set in Dunwall.",88
13091,197,580,9,"Every player can choose his path and skill his own favorite skills. The setting and the light-shadow-effects are pretty cool, but on the other side there are graphical weak points and a quiet hero. Both kill a bit of the awesome atmosphere but all in all it's an immersive game with a deep gameplay experience and many ways to complete the missions. It's a must-have for all action-fans this fall.",88
13092,182,580,9,"Dishonored nails the Thief-style gameplay while missing the BioShock-quality story that would've elevated it into something truly special. It'll have to settle for amazingly cool instead. The impressive depth, range, and balance earn this one an easy recommendation despite a few hiccups and one dreary, excessively long level.",86
13093,5,580,9,"When it comes to art design, the architecture and fashion in Dishonored are among the best I have seen in recent years. The stealth-action starts promisingly but you become too powerful too soon. Nonetheless, this is a thoroughly entertaining game.",84
13094,268,580,9,"Strangely, what holds this title together is not its gameplay, but its place. As a stealth-action game it has its flaws. But sometimes experience wins out over action. Dunwall is full of death, disease, and dishonour. Just being there is enough.",84
13095,199,580,9,A meaningful and successful reinvention of the core ideas behind Deus Ex with a singular focus on making this dense style of game more accessible.,80
13096,72,580,9,"Dishonored's open-ended approach is a commendable one, but we felt the way it cheats the player out of the best ending if they choose the 'wrong' play style to be a bit frustrating. However, while it's a little short, Dishonored is ultimately a very enjoyable experience, with a vivid, unique world that will surprise whoever steps into it.",80
13097,160,580,9,"Dishonored plays like a dream. Whether you're jumping from roof to roof unseen, stopping time with magical powers, going berserk like gunman Terry or sneaking up on someone for a silent kill, it all makes sense. The unlimited freedom feels great. Dishonored doesn't rise to greater heights due to its story. It's being told, but you never really experience it. Consequences of your actions are only heard, not seen.",80
13098,331,580,9,"While the world may be a tad derivative, Corvo's powers more than make up for it. Blink becomes second nature, and it's obviously informed the level design's go-anywhere approach. There's just enough inventiveness here to elevate Dishonored above its numerous competitors, and it's quite hard to imagine going back to games where you can't teleport to the rooftops, or possess fish to access buildings' cellars. [November 2012, p74]",80
13099,64,580,9,"If you're a fan of atmospheric games, espionage or FPS games in general, you should definitely give this one a try.",80
13100,333,580,9,"First-person hand-to-hand combat feels a bit awkward, and the lack of boss battles means this method also feels a bit repetitive - especially if you're not the inventive type. [Dec 2012, p.75]",80
13101,378,580,17,"Dishonored gives you a beautiful, fascinating, new world to explore, and then makes it your playground for grand misdeeds. Its story of political intrigue and betrayal is told at exactly the right pace, balancing information with action in a way that keeps you interested, but not overloaded.",100
13102,28,580,17,"Dishonored, like Thief, or Deus Ex, is one of those timeless games you'll play a dozen times. The game world is gorgeous - a steampunk City 17, the story is spectacularly written and almost depressingly dark and the gameplay is wonderful - either as a stealthy game, or an action fighter... or anywhere in between. Dishonored is all about giving - it gives you the weapon, it gives you the name, and then it gives you the choice - vengeance is entirely up to you.",100
13103,202,580,17,"This a game without the bloat of the modern blockbuster – no co-op mode to allow two friends to assassinate hand-in-hand; no lip-service multiplayer to distract the development team and divert their budget; no upgradable hub to grow or furnish; no open world to impress and weary. Rather you're given a series of handcrafted missions, each with its own optional twists and turns, each with a start, a middle and an end, the plot written by a designer, the script penned by a scriptwriter and the narrative transcribed by you.",100
13104,374,580,17,"However you choose to approach Dishonored, it's a game that asks you to think, plan, be smart. It's a wonderfully empowering game because of this, as you lurk in the shadows knowing the powers you possess and the options you have. It's elegantly designed to make the most of those tools, but isn't afraid of changing the rules in order to keep its (admittedly quite predictable) story bubbling along.",100
13105,19,580,17,Dishonored is put together so well and executes its ideas in such an expert way that it would be difficult to not recommend the game to the highest degree possible.,100
13106,24,580,17,"A rare kind of game that waltzes into a field of debonaire company yet wows the room regardless. You may not know much of his past or even what his intentions are, but you'll be damned if you don't let him take you for a spin around the room. And at the end of your dance, he'll leave you dizzy and giddy, wanting only for more...One of this generation's best efforts.",96
13107,124,580,17,"Dishonored is a sublime, unforgettable experience that any gamer absolutely needs to try.",96
13108,52,580,17,"So does Dishonored stand up on its own two feet? It most certainly does! On the surface it is easy to compare previous games we have loved, and it is easy to see similarities in style and gameplay, but these are elements that have clearly been learned, honed and enhanced to make Dishonored a title that lives high up in the rooftops of being one of my favorite games of 2012 so far.",95
13109,255,580,17,"We love Corvo Attano, we adore how Arkane did it. Dishonored is one of the best experiences of stealth coupled with a sense of completely open and free superpower, in a beautiful world that is a masterpiece. Essential.",94
13110,4,580,17,"A dark and amazing game: Its atmosphere, gameplay and artistic work come together perfectly. Dishonored is just a masterpiece, and no action-fan should miss out on it.",94
13111,408,580,17,"Brilliant. It's perfect for its proposal, and creates a universe that leaves us hoping that this is just the beginning of a great series. It won't give you something really new, but it's different from what we're used to playing in this generation, which is worth appreciating. A game to remember.",94
13112,260,580,17,"A really surprising game, characterized by the great freedom given to the player and the high tension it can induce when crawling in the shadows. We would have liked a lengthier story, but it nevertheless remains a must-buy.",93
13113,432,580,17,"Dishonored is this year's must-have new IP, with fresh ideas, plenty of charm and inventiveness, and tying them together in a stylish fashion. Who said creativity in the games industry was dead, huh? Dishonored says hello. Your free time says goodbye.",93
13114,213,580,17,"It's also one of the prettiest games of recent years. The art direction is nothing short of incredible, and it's matched with a visual aesthetic that makes the world look like an oil painting in motion.",92
13115,430,580,17,"Dishonored is an essential purchase for the self-respecting lover of videogames. The game offers an intelligent and exciting experience which makes this one of the best games of the year. Dunwall is just as impressive in Dishonored as Rapture was in BioShock, and the magic powers are incredibly awesome to use. Eventually there is nothing to criticize this game for. A true must have.",92
13116,336,580,17,"Dishonored succeeds as an ambitious game not content to take one thing and do it well. It demands more than most games ever will of its player, and gives more to players than most other games will ever manage.",90
13117,184,580,17,"The open-style missions--combined with the weapons and abilities--make a thrilling playground to explore, tough enemies present a significant challenge, and the multiple outcomes, characters, and setting create an exhilarating world to discover. Dishonored is a game that you won't want to miss.",90
13118,289,580,17,"Arkane Studios has crafted what's likely the year's best new IP, and by tapping into elements of so many of this generation's greatest games, this adventure sneaks up, grabs you, and won't let go.",90
13119,233,580,17,"What makes Dishonored great are the mechanics made possible by the universe in which it exists. There is a level of replayability and creativity available here that isn't seen in most stealth action games. You aren't just figuring out how you need to get from point A to point B, but how you want to get there.",90
13120,67,580,17,"It's the big intellectual property that comes to retail and shows up the competition by being bold, original, and -- more importantly -- brilliant. Easily deserving of its place among the BioShocks and the Borderlandses, Arkane's aggressive, non-aggressive, unsubtle, sneaky, thoroughly versatile tale of intrigue makes for the kind of game that reminds us this generation isn't all straightforward shooters and ""me too"" trend-seekers.",90
13121,146,580,17,The plot may be straightforward but the level of detail in the world could inspire countless fan fiction stories.,90
13122,140,580,17,The incredible variety of ways you can engage or evade your enemies makes Dishonored impressively flexible and utterly captivating.,90
13123,148,580,17,"By harnessing the best design qualities of titles such as Deus Ex, Thief, BioShock or Ultima Underworld, Dishonored would have been a good game. By adding a unique world with a singular taste, carefully crafted storytelling and a solid plot, and allowing for numerous variations and random parameters inside all of that for an even more personal experience, it's gone all the way to becoming a superb game, one that is a vibrant success, and clear evidence that only video games can make us live such experiences.",90
13124,257,580,17,"Bravely uncompromising in terms of the freedom it offers the player and its willingness to go against current trends in gaming, Dishonored is adult video-gaming at its best.",90
13125,226,580,17,"A brilliant example of how to blend gameplay, narrative and setting. Highly recommended.",90
13126,115,580,17,"Innovation in video games is coveted by many but rarely achieved-Dishonored has this in spades. It may not be perfect, but what Arkane Studios accomplishes is astounding for a debut of an original IP. Its memorable characters, striking game world, and incredible seamlessness between combat, stealth, and magic set a new standard for the action genre. Dishonored is unquestionably Game of the Year material.",90
13127,448,580,17,"Dishonored is truly a gem in a field of sequels and ""me-too"" titles flooding the market. It is a new IP developed with a lot of the conventions of game design in mind. From the beginning the game draws you into the world and never lets you go.",90
13128,290,580,17,"Dishonored is an evocative game. Even without knowing the pedigree of its key developers, you won't fail to spot similarities to the angular black steel of City 17 in Dunwall's quarantine barriers. The European twist on old London is true to the concept art, and what the textures lack in up-close resolution, the world makes up for in grand complexity and generous options.",90
13129,415,580,17,Some slight technical issues mar an otherwise extraordinarily fun game with equal parts stealth and action.,90
13130,87,580,17,"Bethesda made a risky gamble with Dishonored, but the result proves to be brilliant. Sure, it's not perfect, but Dishonored is one of the biggest (and nicest) surprises of the year.",90
13131,88,580,17,"Arkane deserves an applause just for trying this broad approach of choice, and when both design and playability builds an excellent synergy I can't do anything but to bow down to for being probably the best game this fall.",90
13132,321,580,17,"Though it's got its problems, Dishonored is a damn good game, one that makes use of a compelling storyline and wraps it into strong first-person gameplay, and a presentation that's pretty hard to beat.",90
13133,99,580,17,"While it has a few quirks here and there, Dishonored delivers on almost every admirably/crazily ambitious promise made by its creators. Its impeccably crafted gameplay and exquisitely haunting and detailed world stand in loving tribute to all of the iconic and acclaimed franchises that inspired it, and yet it still has a soul and style all its own.",90
13134,83,580,17,"Dishonored grants us a first look at the future of free-flowing gameplay in the triple A segment. Even though it stumbles over its own freedoms here and there, it still is an absolute winner of a game.",90
13135,89,580,17,"With great freedom of choice and and one of the most fascinating settings in modern gaming history, Dishonored is one of the best experiences of this late 2012.",90
13136,389,580,17,"It's an intelligent game, but also one that acknowledges that action needs to feel satisfying and brutal, just as much as stealth needs to feel tense and crafty.",90
13137,427,580,17,Adventure and stealth fans should definitely have this title in their video game libraries.,90
13138,129,580,17,"Surely not your average first person shooter. On the contrary, Dishonored uses stealth in a way only the Thief games have managed to do and delivers a superb steam punk experience we haven't seen in many years.",90
13139,210,580,17,"Precise and elegant systemic design engenders an absurd degree of player agency, but is marred somewhat by a sloppy, unconvincing narrative and soulless characters. [Dec 2012]",90
13140,192,580,17,Dishonored mixes the dystopic worlds of Rapture and City 17 with the assassination-for-a-cause gameplay of Hitman and Assassin's Creed to create an experience that actually feels more original than it probably should have. Both the setting and the gameplay work well and had Dishonored been better in a few more areas it could have been a contender for one of the best games of the year.,89
13141,110,580,17,"Though I was frustrated by the chaos system and how it steers your actions, the heart of Dishonored is about being inventive, adaptable, and ruthless. The team at Arkane Studios has injected an array of cool possibilities into the simulated city of Dunwall, and discovering them all is a blast.",88
13142,145,580,17,"Dishonored goes out of the way to encourage freedom in how you approach your obstacles, and it plays the long game, offering up layers of experimentation.",87
13143,37,580,17,While I did find some disconnect with the main character I found the game did a remarkable job at telling the story and setting the stage for Corvo's relentless pursuit of those who set him up. The amount of character interaction in the game is impressive and the experience can go as deep as you'd want it to go.,85
13144,34,580,17,"Dishonored could well have been the fourth installment of the Thief series, but there are also traces of BioShock and Half-Life 2 here and there. If you compare it to these paragons it's a bit disappointing, but it still shines among this year's games. [12/2012, p.60]",85
13145,228,580,17,"Dishonored is an amazing game, but has its lesser moments. The ingenuity and creativity that can be used by the player is nothing short of spectacular at times and the steam punk style fits the world perfectly. On the other hand the developer could have spent more time on storytelling and the game has some technical faults. Because of this Dishonored never really lives up to its full potential.",83
13146,84,580,17,"Vastly entertaining but highly derivative, Bethesda's latest effort perhaps isn't the behemoth of originality that some expected it to be, but still it is a game that every fan of stealth-oriented action/adventures shouldn't miss.",80
13147,82,580,17,"This is a muscular and confident game, one with the utmost faith in its own fiction and a dedication to gameplay satisfaction at a microscopic level, paid off in dozens of situations that feel completely random and organic, even when they've clearly been planted there for you to find. Tighter control and a more generous approach to replay value would elevate Dishonored to true classic status, but it stands as one of the year's best all the same.",80
13148,199,580,17,"An excellent game, and one worthy of your attention. Dishonored's greatest contribution to the genre games like Deus Ex helped establish will be best appreciated by those who've been with it from the start, but Arkane has made a game rooted in manipulating artificial intelligence that plays just as well to the guy or gal who wants to shoot stuff. That's impressive.",80
13149,413,580,17,"Despite the game's myriad achievements, Dishonored never really rises up to the greatness of its potential. Arkane Studios' effort isn't quite as clever as it needs to be: it doesn't really build up to anything momentous, or have anything special to say, and it's particularly galling to see a world that's been so painstakingly created not live up to its potential when it comes to narrative and context.",80
13150,250,580,17,"Dishonored is a good game. It falls flat a bit on the pacing, the AI has a laundry list of quirks that become frustrating real quick, but on the whole the game delivers an experience you won't find anywhere else this year.",80
13151,41,580,7,"Dishonored made me feel like a person struggling to retain the things that were important to me in a world gone mad. It goes beyond ""role-playing"" to challenge players to draw their own personal moral line in the sand, but does so without being preachy or judgmental.",100
13152,86,580,7,"It should be a crime not to play this amazing videogame. Please, do not miss this adventure, let CorvoAttano conquer your heart.",100
13153,303,580,7,"Dark, ambiguous and deathly refined, Dishonored delivers a world as strikingly beautiful as the stacked simulations within. A masterpiece. [Nov 2012, p.58]",100
13154,240,580,7,Dishonored injects new life into stealth actions and their sophisticated worlds. Awesome work in every detail. [Nov 2012],100
13155,230,580,7,"If you can buy one game in 2012, it should be Dishonored. From production to its ingenious gameplay, Arkhane Studios' title is outstanding, with its multiple references to many games such as Deus Ex, Thief, Bioshock or Half Life 2. It's simple, Dishonored is a 2-in-1 game you can finish either with violence and lots of action sequences, or with discretion, applying stealth strategies to kill your enemies without being seen.",95
13156,179,580,7,"Dishonored is one of the defining games of this generation... A dark, stirring and beautiful game. The new Master Assassin. [Dec 2012, p.63]",95
13157,106,580,7,"Many contemporary action games lead the player through a script-filled corridor and Dishonored is a breath of fresh air in this particular area. The developers have proven that there is still a place for new brands and unique ideas. The concept of a small, simulated virtual world has been pushed further than ever before. Freedom in Dishonored is greater than in the Thief and Deus Ex series, but basic gameplay elements - combat, movement and stealth - are pristine as well. Arkane's game is simply a great achievement.",95
13158,320,580,7,"While the teleporting seems like a cheap alternative to a proper climbing mechanism, Dishonored is still a first class sneak'em up. It manages to find a perfect balance between linear storytelling and free-form gameplay. The unique visual stylings make the game all the more enjoyable. [Oct 2012, p.17]",94
13159,195,580,7,"Whether you like to sneak, like to slay mercilessly, or somewhere in between, there is something here for you. Dishonored is very easily a contender for Game of the Year.",93
13160,296,580,7,"A gorgeous, complex and slick assassination sim, with fascinating systems to play with and huge open levels to explore.",92
13161,213,580,7,"It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, but its gameplay absolutely is.",92
13162,262,580,7,This is a wonderful game if you're going to play it in stealth mode and use all the time you need to plan your assassination. And you have to do it in that way!,91
13163,298,580,7,"Sporting a memorable combination of superb stealth gameplay and gripping action, Dishonored offers simply one of the best single-player experiences in videogames this year.",91
13164,78,580,7,"It's a rare delight to play a game with such consistency of vision, its art design, level architecture, rulesets, storylines and writing all working in lockstep.",90
13165,142,580,7,"Drawing its strength from such greats as Thief, BioShock, Batman: Arkham City, and Portal, Arkane Studios' latest manages to deliver that magical formula of intimately familiar and refreshingly new. It doesn't shine as brightly as it should on PC, and it might not offer the challenge stealth-action fans are used to, but it's an impressive accomplishment that immediately stands out as one of the best things we've seen this year.",90
13166,140,580,7,"It's a rare game that feels so compulsively replayable, but Dishonored is such a game. The compelling abilities, the bold artistic design, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice--these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the truly remarkable games of this year.",90
13167,21,580,7,"Pure FPS fans may not be too excited and there are a few minor problems, but this is a rare gem that anyone looking for a more cerebral action game should be paying serious attention to. And by ""paying serious attention"", I mean that you should buy it.",90
13168,151,580,7,"But in most other respects this is an incredibly assured first-person adventure that grants a dozen hours of top-notch escapism in a brilliantly fleshed-out world, and practically demands an immediate replay so that all its delights may be sampled.",90
13169,365,580,7,The guys at Arkane crafted a fine gem. It's been a while since we had so much freedom and such an amazing gameplay in a title. Chapeau.,90
13170,89,580,7,"Arkane Studios gives us a hybrid single player experience between a first person shooter and a stealth game. Telling a dystopian world, with fun gameplay and astonishing design, Dishonored is one of the best experience in this late 2012.",90
13171,181,580,7,"A candidate for the game of the year. This game is the most important title for all of you, Thief fans. A vengeance story becomes the gamer's freedom with countless choices how to deal with countless missions. I assure you that even after the credits roll you are going to return to Dunwall again and again.",90
13172,161,580,7,"Dishonored is a love letter to everyone who has longed for more stealth action games in the vein of Thief. With its vast levels, openness, and its plethora of different ways of play this is a game that should be a great fit for practically everyone.",90
13173,302,580,7,"We can draw comparisons with other titles all day, but everything is based on something. Dishonored remains a unique gem in a beautiful, yet chaotic world, with flawless gameplay. [December 2012]",90
13174,110,580,7,"The console versions of Dishonored have more graphical hiccups like framerate issues and screen tearing (especially on PS3). The textures look a little muddy no matter how you play, but go for PC if you have the option.",88
13175,268,580,7,"While I am disappointed that the story failed to deliver in the end, Dishonored is still easily a top contender for Game of the Year 2012. The gameplay is just that fun and special.",85
13176,10,580,7,"You could say that Dishonored has a sufficient amount of alternative paths and mission outcomes to warrant several playthroughs (again, something you won't find in many games today). The PC version was spared of a few graphical issues that appear to be plaguing the consoles editions, so I guess that's another good reason to go with this variant.",85
13177,143,580,7,Quotation forthcoming.,84
13178,204,580,7,"Dishonored is as if Deus Ex had a beautiful child with Bioshock whose ancestors were that of Half-Life descent. While it certainly has its issues, such as a plot that isn't as fleshed out as it could be, and low-resolution textures inhabiting the world, it's still one of the better new intellectual properties this year. By offering multiple combat systems, a superbly crafted world and a high volume of alternate paths to take, Dishonored accomplishes great feats that will pave the way for future action-adventure games.",80
13179,7,580,7,"Dishonored rarely challenges the players, but it doesn't take them for fools, either, so that's an achievement compared to other games in the genre. Just don't expect strokes of genius like the Shalebridge Cradle level from Thief: Deadly Shadows.",75
13180,408,2501,13,"Those who have been longing for years for a Parasite Eve sequel could get slightly dissapointed by The 3rd Birthday, which continues the story, but not the gameplay, becoming a more linear and repetitive game, focused almost only on combat. But it is a great action game, with lots of customization options and a good control scheme.",87
13181,108,2501,13,"Expect 15-20 hours of gameplay just to get through the game and that's not including any replays for secrets, alternate paths, or checking out any of the secrets or unlocks. The 3rd Birthday rivals a lot of console action-RPG's these days, and while it probably would have played better and received a wider audience on the PS3, I have to commend Square Enix for publishing a fantastic sequel and an exceptional gameplay experience on the PSP that any fan of the genre or the series should definitely check out.",87
13182,213,2501,13,"A great game, no question. It has depth, great production values throughout (despite the disappointing script) and the raw mechanics give PSP gamers a mostly satisfying RPG-shooter despite the system's inherent flaws.",85
13183,395,2501,13,"This is the calibre of game that you would expect to be coming out for the PSP at this point in time. With unique features, nail biting battle and an interesting story concept The Third Birthday is more than worth the purchase.",85
13184,115,2501,13,"If you can get past the difficulty swings, The 3rd Birthday is a surprisingly fun experience. It's pretty; it's easy to dive into (a pun!); and the story is told in such a way that it's easy to follow… especially for a Square-Enix game!",83
13185,197,2501,13,"The movies are eye-candy, the plot is okay and some role-play elements have found their way into the game. Unbelievable what Square Enix is able to do with the PSP nowadays.",82
13186,226,2501,13,"Not a game that's best suited to the PSP but, if you can look past its refusal to adapt itself to a handheld console, The 3rd Birthday is a rich, engaging experience.",82
13187,324,2501,13,"One of the PSP's most original titles. [Issue#203, p.88]",80
13188,255,2501,13,"The 3rd Birthday is different from its elder brothers, being an action-based adventure with few RPG elements. Although the visuals are stunning, the gameplay suffers from a few glitches, along with the metaphysical storyline, that has nothing to do with the original Parasite Eve titles.

It's definitely worth checking out for PSP owners who are hungry for new games on their handheld.

13546,298,619,7,"Fast-paced Fantasy-Action, story-driven with great characters. Unfortunately Bioware has kicked some classic RPG-elements, that made Origins that kind of great. Poor thing is, that identical Questareas are used multiple times, just with different names.",88
13547,111,619,7,"Dragon Age II might stir up a little controversy for the radical changes BioWare implemented in the series, but many of them were done to make the game more accessible. It's still the Dragon Age many of us know and love, it's just growing up a bit. If you're looking for a fantastic adventure with incredible dialogue, vastly improved visuals and visceral combat, this game won't disappoint.",88

13549,197,619,7,"Unfortunately, Dragon Age 2 has not met my expectations. The epic story of Dragon Age: Origins made me play the game for hours, but Dragon Age 2 lacks a gripping story. Most of the time you create bloodbaths by running through the same dull dungeons. There are some improvements like a talking main character, but it's not a new Dragon Age, it's rather a hack'n'slay with a touch of roleplaying. If you missed some action in Dragon Age: Origins, then you should get Dragon Age 2, but if you loved the atmosphere, the story and the freedom of choice, then you should expect something different.",86
13550,365,619,7,"If you were expecting a game on par or even better than Origins, you'll probably be a bit disappointed by this second chapter. A year and a half of development isn't enough to craft a masterpiece, even for Bioware, and the final product is plagued by bugs and repetitive dungeons.

13553,213,619,7,"The combat is more responsive and bloody, you don't need to fight the inventory system anymore, and conversations are more engaging thanks to the adapted Mass Effect wheel.

13563,41,619,7,"Dragon Age 2 is a long, epic adventure that will give you your money's worth. It's just that some of the execution didn't feel spot-on. The story needed work, and the characters sometimes felt flat.",80

13569,110,619,7,"On all platforms, Dragon Age II caters to an audience that didn't connect with Origins, while alienating those who did. This may result in a better console experience, but considering that Dragon Age: Origins was a love letter to old-school PC RPGs, BioWare's neglect of the sequel's PC release is tragic. I appreciate the technical refinements, but improving the polish doesn't do much good when the basics still need work.",78

13571,129,619,7,"&#932;here was no time nor passion for Dragon Age II. But still, the gameplay mechanics are great and the battle system is so furious and rabid that could challenge even the most hardcore RPG players. And at the same time, it can be a great introduction into the Dragon Age Universe for the less experienced ones.",75
13572,48,619,7,"Ultimately, Dragon Age II will be judged depending on the player camp: RPG veterans will throw it away, while casual gamers will find themselves at home in this simplified world. Because Dragon Age isn't necessarily a bad game, it just fell victim to the money grab started by the success of Origins, with all the negative things that come with it.",75
13573,136,619,7,"Although I question Bioware's prioritization of interactive cinema over interesting and variable gameplay, that doesn't mean Dragon Age 2 isn't worth experiencing. This game grabs and tears at your emotions like few others can and that is worth a lot.",75
13574,226,619,7,"While the gameplay is far from perfect, Dragon Age II is an absolute must for anyone interested in the world, the lore and a good story - but anyone hoping for something that feels and plays like Origins might want to adjust their expectations accordingly.",72

You should be able to get a good idea of how well you can handle 25 to 30 hours of that combat system. For those that hated the methodical battles of DA: Origins, you will probably love the fast paced, mindless combat of Dragon Age II.",70
13576,88,619,7,"Dragon Age II continues the tradition of being a solid RPG in the spirit of the original game, but fails to fulfill its true potential due to sloppy quality control and incessant corner-cutting. This is a game that truly could have outshined Dragon Age: Origins with its many improved mechanics, but instead leaves us slightly disappointed.",70

13578,427,619,7,"It isn't so much consolitis that consigned the sequel to the pit of disappointment for me, nor is it crying over PC-flavored milk because it doesn't try to harness what the platform is capable of doing. Instead, the wholesale changes reflect a deeper problem in assuming that your audience isn't as smart as it was to enjoy the first game. It makes the only answer that of dumbing down the sharp edges in an effort to appeal to a wider audience.",60
13579,64,619,7,"Dragon Age II isn't a bad game, but it is a huge disappointment from such a respected and otherwise consistent developer. While the combat has been improved significantly, its failings in other areas – areas in which BioWare usually excel – are numerous and baffling. In the 32 hours it took me to finish the game, I spent the last 10 wishing it would hurry up and get to the good bit at the end. And then it turned out the ending was a bit non-committal and rubbish, too. A shame.",60

It's clearly trying to emulate the range of worlds and playstyles of games like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age in a sci-fi setting, but isn't quite up to the task. It’s buggy, flawed, and, frankly, kind of cheap. This is absolutely a SyFy Channel-grade RPG, with all that implies.",60

For some reason it struggles to pull out the stops needed to make something great, save for the time it outdid itself with Of Orcs and Men. With The Technomancer, we have a game trying to be a sprawling sci-fi adventure while paradoxically not trying much at all.",50
13779,181,2633,7,"The project, which pays for boring fight system, uninteresting game content and shallow script along with poor voice acting. Good art style, and several nice scenes are not enough for good game in thirty-something hours on boredom.",50
13780,377,2633,7,"Not good but not awful, The Technomancer serves more as a showcase for the future potential of Spiders than a game worth playing on its own merit.",50
13781,34,2633,7,"The game offers five endings but I’m sure most players will not even see one, because The Technomancer is disappointingly shallow, confined and devoid of passion. [09/2016, p.42]",50

But it’s like the pancakes an eager eight-year-old tried to make their dad for Father’s Day: the ingredients are lacking in quality and the skill to assemble them just wasn’t present. All the little reasons The Technomancer is worth experiencing, all the little moments where the vision of a better game shines through, aren’t quite enough to justify choking down its shortcomings.",49
13783,146,2633,7,"The Technomancer is not grossly bad, but it feels cheap and is deeply mediocre. It’s a cheap game, and worse: it’s no longer a cheap price. As I said in the first paragraph, I can’t think of a reason anyone would want to buy it over any other game in existence.",45
13784,111,2633,7,"I was disappointed by the clunky combat, dreary color palette, and meh leveling options of 2013’s Mars: War Logs, and I remain doubly so by The Technomancer, a second entry in the Mars RPG universe also from Spiders Studio.",45
13785,64,2633,7,I keep coming back to the voice acting but a big part of an RPG is the how the story is conveyed and this game falls flat on it’s face here making the story seem drab rather than the colour tale they have crafted. The environments are nice but overall nothing to write home about. The game looked good on paper but unfortunately it has too many pitfalls causing it to feel very lackluster.,40

13896,160,603,9,"DmC: Devil May Cry is a fantastic game and a very successful reboot of the franchise. The new Dante is very convincing, just like the dark world and accessible gameplay. The increased accessibility might not fully cater to Devil May Cry-fans of old, but there's something for everyone here.",85
13897,328,603,9,"To put it simply, DmC: Devil May Cry breathes new life into Capcom's beloved action franchise and anyone who enjoys this type of game experience would be foolish to pass it up.",85
13898,326,603,9,"A lot of people have complained about the look of the new Devil May Cry and frankly, they should just play the game instead. Ninja Theory has changed things up quite a bit, but they haven't touched the core of the franchise. DmC is an excellent hack & slash game which has a few problems, but then again: nobody's perfect.",85
13899,129,603,9,"Although the style of the new Dante is somewhat ambiguous there's no denying that DmC is an enjoyable, well-paced and quite beautiful game.",85
13900,337,603,9,Ninja Theory didn’t just overhaul Dante. It also infused the series’ plot with some big — and surprisingly timely — ideas.,85
13901,188,603,9,"There's some annoyance to be had with the cutscenes, loading, and platforming bits, but the core action gameplay that's become synonymous with Devil May Cry still stands out as some of the best in the business.",83
13902,228,603,9,"An incredible hack 'n slash game with a great fighting system that is shown beautifully on screen. Moves seamlessly come together under the guidance of an amazing soundtrack, which constantly pushes you to set an even better score. That this symbiosis of style and content isn't found in the other elements of the game, becomes painfully clear when Dante is trying to act though with bad jokes and terrible one-liners. The writers hint towards an intelligent and deep plot, but when it fails to deliver the disappointment is even bigger. DmC: Devil May Cry is played for the action, and the stylish, beautiful action alone.",83
13903,268,603,9,"Ninja Theory have been faithful to the original games, but still added enough of their own lick of originality to warrant the return.",83
13904,332,603,9,"It looks, sounds and feels like nothing else out there, and while you might not squeeze quite as much out of it, you're still looking at the first great gaming experience of 2013. Welcome back, old pal.",80
13905,72,603,9,"While the narrative may have been stripped back, the same can't be said for the combat system, which is more complex than ever, but crucially, never overwhelms.",80
13906,345,603,9,"The gameplay is more accessible than its peers, but that's no bad thing, and there's still plenty of depth and challenge on offer to delight hardcore players. Where the title disappoints is in its narrative, which, despite some excellent performance capture and voice acting, fails to ever really get started.",80
13907,58,603,9,"It positively crushes the gameplay of the fourth installment and does away with the overused backtracking. With a story that finally explores the truth behind Dante's supernatural heritage and reveals the decisions that lead him to become a hero, DMC achieves something no previous installment could not. It's the art direction and technical problems that let the package down, and they often do so in a big way. We encountered visual hiccups galore, shaky animations and a major crash on our PS3 review copy, yet the game remained enjoyable to the end.",80
13908,148,603,9,"Ninja Theory made it: its Devil May Cry reboot is delicious, provocative and beautiful, all the while offering a solid beat'em all gameplay. The platforming sequences sometimes lack precision and the whole game can quite easily be don in less than 10 hours, but it's clearly a success.",80
13909,64,603,9,"This is a title that gets most of the important parts right when it comes to an action game. It makes you feel like a bad arse, thanks to the cool-looking combat and easy-to-produce combos, but remains deep to allow people to delve into the system and pull off some wild moves.",80
13910,83,603,9,"Even though Ninja Theory didn't finish as spectacularly as I would have hoped after the first half of the campaign, this game leaves you in the soothing certainty that you can count on Dante again. For the most part DmC is a pretty damned exciting and good-looking title that exactly knows where it belongs and what it wants to be. And because the Cambridge-based developers are quite the storytellers, this technical and elegant slasher works on even more levels than just the combat, something that was never really true for the DMC's of old.",80
13911,87,603,9,"DMC is intense, but a bit slow for the seasoned player. The most important thing is the combat, though... and it's actually pretty good.",80
13912,331,603,9,"By obliterating the worn exterior and souping up the interior, Ninja Theory has done the very difficult, and that is they've made Devil May Cry relevant again. Not only that, they've also made it accessible where previously it was definitely not, both aesthetically and mechanically, without ignoring the hardcore crowd who've been up most nights chewing their fingers into nubs ever since this surprise initiative was announced. [February 2013, p72]",80
13913,240,603,9,The new Dante character may have lost his blonde hair and leather coat but he's got a new aura of rebel. And his lust for killing monsters is undiminished. [Jan 2013],80
13914,242,603,9,"Ninja Theory are calling the DMC shots now and they're doing it well. The fighting mechanics are a little bit easier to master and perhaps not as deep as before, but on the other hand the storytelling is improved with skillfully crafted cutscenes. Put up with a rather dull introduction and you're in for a great game.",80
13915,186,603,9,"If nothing else, DmC is sure to entertain with many hours of button hammering, fizzing combat. However, the experience as whole has hugely benefitted from a reboot and those who are familiar with the series will appreciate the new features and relish the opportunity relive Dante’s origin story. DmC, as a combat driven action title has held together the soul of the franchise, while enhancing all in-game features to create a unique experience for everyone.",80
13916,140,603,9,"The frame rate flitters between playable and jerky, while many textures often load in slower than the rest of a scene, resulting in odd looking objects. There are also a few odd audio glitches, such as Dante's speech cutting off mid-sentence. These issues don't render the game unplayable, but they do make the PlayStation 3 version the weakest of the three.",75
13917,387,603,9,"It's certainly not without its issues, and at this stage in a generation you feel like a game should probably be wielding more graphical clout, but the game's combat more than makes up for it. It's simply brilliant, and you can have a lot of fun trying out the different options it presents you. Once Dante's picked up every weapon there's simply so much available to you, and it's what sets the game apart.",70
13918,389,603,9,There's no denying that gamers can walk away from the experience feeling a lasting good impression of the revamp. The new direction of the franchise holds a lot of promising potential and Ninja Theory still comes out showing that the duties of keeping things new and fresh are in capable hands. Here's to new beginnings.,70
13919,210,603,9,"Flawed, and the new Dante isn't as cool as he thinks - but the gameplay is as sterling as ever. There's plenty to love, but fans will be divided. [March 2013, p.74]",70
13920,374,603,17,"As DmC progresses, it becomes clear that it is a phenomenal action game in its own right, with an interesting alternate take on the fiction and a sublime handle on action gaming. A title that taps into the kind of action the likes of Platinum Games are known for. Ninja Theory has shown they know how to weave superb action, biting dialogue and a brilliant visual style into a wonderful, cohesive whole. A blistering start to 2013.",100
13921,199,603,17,"Everything in this new game exists in service of making it a great game in its own right, not in stoking your nostalgia for the games you played over the last decade. As a character action game, it hits all the notes--fast, robust action, marvelous visual style, and a tremendous sense of attitude--you could want in this type of game.",100
13922,63,603,17,"I highly recommend Devil may Cry. It’s a great action game that hangs with the best the genre can offer. Combine that with its cool aesthetic and engaging characters, and you have the first can’t-miss release of 2013.",100
13923,77,603,17,"DmC is everything a reboot should be-confident, thoughtful, and brazenly unafraid to sacrifice a few sacred cows along the way. For all the backlash they've had to face, developer Ninja Theory has delivered the most polished, refreshing, and memorable hack-and-slash experience in recent memory.",95
13924,225,603,17,"Overall DMC is a great reboot, probably the best reboot that I can think of in game industry. I would compare it to the Batman Begins of the video game world.",95
13925,192,603,17,"DmC Devil May Cry is a great action title and a worthy modernizing of a classic franchise that was a little too “of its generation” for modern gamers to embrace. However, no one should have any problem embracing DmC Devil May Cry.",95
13926,67,603,17,"A beautiful, bold, and supremely enjoyable videogame in its own right. It deserves to be praised...Action games may come deeper and harder than this, but few are as pleasurable.",90
13927,204,603,17,"Every element is perfectly in place with dynamic gameplay, inspiring level design, a fantastic Noisia/Combichrist soundtrack and an over the top modern tone that wholly compliments the series. Combine all that with a 15-20 hour campaign full of an emotionally resonant (and often outlandish) story, and all but the most jaded gamers will walk away satisfied.",90
13928,84,603,17,"Technically perfectible but very, very, very entertaining. Ninja Theory's Devil May Cry is a hell of a lot of fun, with tons of gameplay modes and combos to unleash.",90
13929,289,603,17,"The surface changes lead to a more varied world and relatable characters, while the action itself is a benchmark for the genre.",90
13930,110,603,17,Ninja Theory stays faithful to the heart and soul of the series with this reimagining – and that's what matters.,90
13931,432,603,17,"A bright new beginning for Dante, Ninja Theory's DmC is a triumph and a positive first step towards things to come. Capcom's most successful collaboration with a western studio to date, DmC is also Ninja Theory's finest game. SSSensational.",90
13932,290,603,17,"The combat system is deep, satisfying, and just welcoming enough to let you in, before losing the smile, slapping your face and making you pay attention. Ninja Theory has bottled Danté's soul, and given him an excellent new life.",90
13933,448,603,17,"Sure, the combat can be argued all day long by purists of the series, but if that is your hang up, you are denying yourself an amazing game to play. Fans of the genre, series and games in general definitely need to see what Ninja Theory has achieved here. It's easily an early contender for my favorite games of the year.",90
13934,451,603,17,"Combat is razor-sharp and stuffed with combo potential, just as you'd expect from a Devil May Cry game.",90
13935,250,603,17,"The familiarity of the controls in combat help in welcoming DmC's distinctive art direction and new look for Dante. The attention paid to the script and narrative manages to make these intermissions worth watching, and not because of over-the-top gunplay or sword work; that's for you to control in-game.",90
13936,428,603,17,"The game itself is categorically excellent and even if it isn't quite what you might expect from something labeled Devil May Cry, this is a robust, deep and brilliantly executed action game, not to mention a sterling effort at reinventing something that was – if DMC4 was anything to go by – beginning to grow stale.",90
13937,233,603,17,"DMC does action extraordinarily well and manages to make Dante look like the epitome of cool with every move, and it's wonderful to see this feat in motion. Over and over and over again.",90
13938,10,603,17,"Just an extremely satisfying game, even with its occasional glitches. If you're into dynamic combat and constant chaotic over-the-top action, Dmc is the game to buy. It's a shame they didn't make the story longer, since it won't take an average gamer more than 6-7 hours to finish it on normal difficulty.",90
13939,120,603,17,"The slightly disappointing storyline aside, it's impressive just how well the whole thing gels together, and DmC: Devil May Cry succeeds on pretty much every level imaginable.",90
13940,37,603,17,Devil May Cry has everything a solid action title should have including a responsive and exciting combat system accompanied by great looking visuals and a heavy soundtrack.,90
13941,50,603,17,"DmC is a superb reboot that delivers on all fronts, and does it with aplomb. For the first time in ages, we're excited to see where Devil May Cry goes next.",90
13942,181,603,17,"A pumped-up hack and slash beat 'em up video game that is more than your average restart of the popular series. Dante has all those skeptics and mild optimists for breakfast in bringing first-rate action experience in a splendidly depicted world. ""I am an Antichrist, I am an anarchist"".",90
13943,34,603,17,"What a great start to the year! First big premiere already brought us a thrilling game that raised the bar for other contenders for the action game of 2013 title. Ninja Theory did a fantastic job revitalizing the series and I hope Dante stays with them for years to come. [CD-Action 02/2013, p.36]",90
13944,213,603,17,"DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud...This is digital action at its finest, steeped in the blood of angels, spiced with gunpowder, and garnished with a middle finger.",89
13945,179,603,17,"A dazzling reboot that gets everything right bar its boss fights. [Feb 2013, p.71]",89
13946,52,603,17,"Devil May Cry still has its flaws and are readily visible in the game; the camera angles can be frustrating at times, for instance when Dante jumps off a wall in mid-air he will miss the platform that he was meant to land on and fall down. If you over jump a platform you will just fall off and lose a small portion of your health. The soundtrack is really upbeat throughout the game with hard rock but can soon get rather annoying.",89
13947,262,603,17,"Rebooting Devil May Cry with a new style was not a simple task, and Ninja Theory had to struggle with the hostility of many fans. But the team has proved its point, and against the odds has created a great chapter in the series and maybe the best game from its curriculum.",88
13948,439,603,17,"Regardless of what you think of Devil May Cry, or Ninja Theory as a developer, or Capcom as a publisher – DmC: Devil May Cry is a fun game.",88
13949,260,603,17,"Ninja Theory succeeded in re-imagining a storied franchise making it fresher while keeping it very satisfying to be played, and the new Dante proves to be a successful character: we love his new boastful, poser British style. It could have been a bit longer and sported better graphics, but it's surely a suggested buy.",87
13950,255,603,17,"DmC is a great reboot for the Devil May Cry franchise. A solid and brilliant combat system full of options. Ninja Theory creates a frantic campaign with good gameplay and interesting extras, but with some technical issues.",86
13951,4,603,17,"Ninja Theory's vision of the Devil May Cry series is a great Hack and Slash. Maybe Dante looks different now, but his killing abilities and bad-ass attitude remain the same.",86
13952,182,603,17,"The original Devil May Cry paved new roads in action gaming. As a remake, DmC: Devil May Cry largely repaves the same road, but a gleefully brutal combat system and the patented bad attitude bring the sexy back to mass demon extermination. Even better, the action endures throughout a lengthy campaign with few drops in the tempo - no small feat, that.",85
13953,145,603,17,"Ninja Theory has done right by Devil May Cry, delivering a striking game that honors the series' essence while still feeling like the product of a distinct vision. If you can forgive a few excesses--like the pretty-but-toothless boss fights--you'll find that your old friend hasn't changed all that much on the inside, in spite of his new style.",85
13954,408,603,17,"If you can leave all the controversy aside, you'll find an experience any action game fan will like. Its polished gameplay, its stunning art and its frenetic proposal are certainly something you should try.",85
13955,365,603,17,"Making one of the best gameplay styles around even better is no easy task, and Ninja Theory was able to do it only partially. Still, this is a great action game, fast paced and spectacular, that should be enjoyed by any fan of the genre.",85
13956,230,603,17,"Stop worrying, this new Dante is one hell of a stylish demon killer. Ninja Theory has done a pretty wonderful job on the game's background to give a fresh start to this Capcom saga, thanks to a great work from their artists. But DmC clearly contains the old Devil May Cry DNA in its gameplay: nervous, brutal and brilliant. In spite of some approximations in the platform phases and some limits of the Unreal Engine, DmC is the perfect hybrid of new ideas and respect of the saga legacy.",85
13957,5,603,17,Ninja Theory had big boots to fill. But they mastered the reboot of the iconic stylish action series. The fighting system manages the balance between traditional dynamics and contemporary combo madness. The art design is close to perfect. The narrative though is sometimes losing focus and refuses to give the characters room to grow for most of the time. Nonetheless this is the first big action highlight of the year.,85
13958,151,603,17,"The franchise's tight combat mechanics and deep move sets are present and accounted for, bolstered by a decent story and new platforming mechanics. There are some flaws, but DmC is so consistently good that it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with Ninja Theory's series reboot.",85
13959,174,603,17,DmC: Devil May Cry shows the story of Dante from an alternate perspective and it does so very stylishly.,85
13960,54,603,17,"An enjoyable romp, a ludicrous explosion of colour, fun and ideas wrapped up in some tight visuals and acting. If you’re stupid enough to dismiss this as a bad DMC game because it’s too shallow for your tastes or not Japanese enough, then you’re also being ignorant and too dismissive to appreciate a damn good action game at least.",85
13961,89,603,17,DmC: Devil May Cry is one of the brightest action game of this year. A game that melds visual style and technical combos in a truly unique way.,85
13962,19,603,17,"All in all, DMC was a fun surprise to review and one of the best games released this year.",85
13963,124,603,17,"A worthy rebirth of the franchise as it possesses fast-paced chaotic action, which is diversified by the several weapons that make up Dante’s arsenal, an engaging soundtrack, and a story worthy of the DmC franchise.",85
13964,320,603,17,"Ninja Theory has done a fine job transforming the über Japanese game to their own image. Westernized Dante is a true devil, and there's no crying about it. [Feb 2013]",84
13965,82,603,17,"Ninja Theory has absolutely nailed the leading man and the combat system - by far the most important things - and DmC is clearly a labour of love, a tribute as well as a new beginning.",80
13966,257,603,17,"An almost entirely successful reboot that still offers deep and flexible combat but in a more accessible and approachable form – and really, the new Dante's not that bad.",80
13967,184,603,17,"DmC's gameplay speaks for itself. It's challenging, accessible, and experimental in all the right ways, while retaining the top-notch combat that put Dante on the map in the first place. Sure, it's not without its shortcomings, but DmC easily ranks among the action game elite.",80
13968,389,603,17,"Although it can't quite sustain an initially interesting premise and refreshingly inventive ideas throughout the full length of its twenty half hour chapters, this is a Devil May Cry enlived with renewed assurance, nestled in more than capable hands.",80
13969,336,603,17,"The game's tone falls apart as it fluctuates between deadpan and dopey, but the action never falters. Fights are fast, intense and fun, and they're aided by a world where nothing is what it seems and nothing stays the same for long. I just wish Ninja Theory had matched the mesmerizing level design with a character who I actually want to spend time around.",80
13970,448,603,7,"The game really is just pure fun to play. On a high end PC, the game looks amazing in cut scenes and in the fast-paced combat. If you are an action game fan, you owe it to yourself to own DmC. You will not be disappointed.",95
13971,83,603,7,"You'll leave with the knowledge that sometimes better tech really does make for a better game. On the PC you read the battles better and more immediately and have an easier time, translating the desired action onto the screen. You really become a better fighter in this incarnation. In a genre where milliseconds can make all the difference, this ultimately makes for a more enjoyable experience in total. Ninja Theory really did go the extra mile for the PC, giving DmC the last little push it needed to become something really special.",90
13972,204,603,7,"In what seems like commonplace lately, the PC version of DmC: Devil May Cry is the definitive version to play. While the mouse and keyboard controls aren't as precise as playing with a controller, the graphical upgrades and increase in frame rate make an already impressive game even more stunning.",90
13973,84,603,7,"Obviously, DmC for PC is graphically better than the console counterparts. Fighting with Dante at 60fps is an amazing experience, with all the latest graphical effects you could imagine. Unfortunately no hi-res textures are present, but still it's an eye-candy roller-coaster.",90
13974,389,603,7,"It may not be for hardcore fans of the series who are attuned to a particular playstyle, but for everyone else DmC: Devil May Cry is a highly accomplished character action game with a lot to love. It’s a different type of game than its predecessors but one that’s wholly successful at what it does, bringing relevancy back to the Devil May Cry name.",90
13975,302,603,7,"It’s an awesome game, despite its flaws. Whether you like the young Dante or not, is purely a matter of personal taste. But that’s not an excuse to ignore this gem. [March 2013]",90
13976,298,603,7,"Beautiful visuals, challenging gameplay – Ninja Theory's reboot of the Devil May Cry series is already one of the best action games of 2013.",89
13977,213,603,7,"Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears. DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud...This is digital action at its finest.",89
13978,262,603,7,"DmC Devil May Cry is a great reboot and an excellent action game. Its PC version can run at 60 fps, and shows better graphics!",88
13979,208,603,7,"It is elegant gameplay combined with a nice social commentary on the side which makes it unique, and I can’t recall the number of times I smiled as I performed a perfect combo.",88
13980,4,603,7,"Ninja Theory’s vision of Devil May Cry series is a great Hack and Slash. Maybe Dante looks different now, but its killing abilities and badass attitude remain the same.",86
13981,28,603,7,"The sense of characters being real emotional beings is far above most other releases, even if the actual emotions being displayed are not particularly new. If you've never played a Devil May Cry game, this is a somewhat lighter but far more entertaining offering. For series devotees, give it a chance - there's humour here plus action and depth if you crave it.",85
13982,365,603,7,"Ninja Theory's last game is an amazing experience. This is the most complete version of DMC Devil May Cry, although there is no support for DirectX 11 and the game suffer from some minor technical issues.",85
13983,220,603,7,"DMC is a really nice game as well as the QLOC PC porting. Significant visual impact, flawless optimization, good performances even with medium-low hardware configurations. It's a game that takes some distance from the previous installments of the saga and the white-haired Dante no longer exists, but is it really a problem?",85
13984,89,603,7,"DMC: Devil May Cry sublimates the best of the genre and conquest PC user with a fast-paced and eye-catching title, made of pure action.",85
13985,296,603,7,"Whatever your thoughts on the redesigned Dante, this is a worthy entry in the series with a marvellous combat system at its core.",83
13986,143,603,7,Capcom has done an excellent implementation for the PC.,82
13987,142,603,7,"Is the combat up to par with, say, Devil May Cry 3? Not quite. And no, the series will probably never top Devil May Cry 4's Dante vs Nero opening in terms of sheer testosterone-fueled zaniness. But Ninja Theory's managed to meld its own wildly inventive sensibilities with an obvious reverence for Devil May Cry's legacy, and the result is a very special experience.",80
13988,140,603,7,"There's no point in looking back: Dante has got a brand-new future in front of him, and if DmC: Devil May Cry is anything to go by, it's going to be a great one.",80
13989,226,603,7,"It might not be what Devil May Cry fans have been praying for, but it's a damn good game in its own right. It's like that, and that's the way it is.",80
13990,146,603,7,"Overall if you've got the rig and a game controller plugged in then DmC: Devil May Cry is great start to a new direction for the series, and hopefully one that will get to keep exploring this new, grittier Dante.",80

Sharing one's creations is also a high point here, even though the overall experience can be rather short and a 3DS screen does not go as far as a real canvas.",80
13996,200,1872,1,"Pokémon Art Academy is a polished, enjoyable time sink, with intuitive controls. It’s very easy to pick up and play, and uses the Pokémon licence well to introduce a new group of potential artists to the Art Academy series.",80
13997,277,1872,1,"It's a well-realized, totally engaging experience that will appeal to both the curious and long-term fans alike, and uses its host of versatile, recognizable characters to put across a broad range of styles and techniques.",80

14514,440,1102,17,"Combining so many elements into such a cohesive story, THQ has reminded me why I love gaming. The only fault I could find other than the character models was the relatively short single player campaign; on the hard level I finished the game in less than 7 hours.",93

The single player was disappointing in that it ended when it did- it was like showing up at a party and not even getting to kick off your shoes before it's over.,72
14580,413,1102,7,"Ultimately, Homefront's threadbare campaign is like a beautiful, sweeping piece of music being awkwardly recited by a child on a recorder.",70
14581,110,1102,7,"With its interesting premise, evocative opening sequence, and clever variation on multiplayer, Homefront has a strong foundation. It's a shame that technical limitations and a derivative single-player campaign keep the game from realizing its potential.",70
14582,146,1102,7,"Incredibly rough around the edges, wasteful of unique opportunities, and light on content, we quite frankly question the longevity of this title. But you know what? There are worse games you could spend your money on.",70
14583,213,1102,7,"Homefront is certainly one of the most unique shooters I've ever played, driven by an ingenious and surprisingly well-fleshed out plot and a dark and dreary, realistic setting. But it also controls and feels like a typical shooter, looks like a game that's several years old, and most importantly, has an inexcusably brief campaign.",70
14584,140,1102,7,Homefront's engrossing vision of the future and gratifying competitive multiplayer outweigh its squandered potential and workaday game mechanics.,70
14585,151,1102,7,"If you're contemplating Homefront as an inclusive package, forget it. Consider it to be a better-than-expected multiplayer distraction at best, and wait for E3 in June to see if we get an apology for the campaign and an explanation as to how the sequel will be better.",70
14586,303,1102,7,"If you're going to buy Homefront, do so for the multiplayer. The campaign is six hours you'll never get back. [Apr 2011, p.52]",70

14592,171,1102,7,"Korea invades America, but nothing in this game will make you care. The actors are bad, the story is stupid and the graphics feels outdated, not to mention an only 4 hour long singleplayer campaign. The multiplayer is clever though and the sole reason to get this game.",60
14593,165,1102,7,"Homefront is a solid, if uneven, experience that features an excellent multiplayer mode, with a very average single-player campaign attached.",60
14594,106,1102,7,"It is extremely hard to recommend a game which seems half-baked, has a short single-player campaign and is ugly. Leaders of the genre can remain calm – Korea's invasion of USA isn't a big enough reason to sound an alarm. Who knows, perhaps an announced sequel will become such a reason? For now, I still count on the developers' hard work with patching up their latest product.",55
14595,136,1102,7,"It's a shame the game engine isn't flashier, because it does put up a good fight, but without a sexy bullet point like Killzone's graphics, Bad Company's destructible buildings, or MAG's 256 players, it's going to be hard to draw new players in.",50
14596,29,1102,7,"It's dreadfully average and far too quickly finished, providing nothing more than the most basic type of fun on the first run-through and little incentive to revisit. Not because it's broken; just because it's boring.",50
14597,149,1102,7,"Scenario and atmosphere are here. The rest is just missing or undermined by flaws, from its dramatically brief campaign to the numerous technical limitations. What came as a challenger for Call of Duty doesn't even end up close to a good FPS. So much for the promises, Kaos Studios.",40
14598,111,1102,7,"It is difficult to say anything good about Homefront. It's a half-baked idea crammed into a half-baked game, and while I'll freely admit that a quasi-realistic military-style first-person shooter with a heavy focus on the multiplayer mode is not exactly my cup of tea, I've played enough of them at this point that I feel confident in saying when one has gone horribly, horribly wrong.",40
14599,142,1102,7,"The problem with Homefront isn't just that it sucks, which it certainly does. The problem is that it reveals just how badly many first-person shooters are starting to suck. It's a game that magnifies the preexisting trend of developing to the lowest common denominator.",40

14931,317,475,8,"It’s no ""Wind Waker"" (then again, what is?) but, in its own quiet and subtle way, developer Level-5’s dungeon-clearing RPG is as amusing and polished an entry into the genre as anything Miyamoto has designed for the past two generations of Nintendo consoles.",90
14932,79,475,8,"A game for people who want a nice, long haul game, not a game that lasts a few bowls of chips. Such games risk repetitiveness and boredom, but Dark Cloud 2 stared these dragons down.",90
14933,140,475,8,"Every element of the game, from the georama system to the weapon upgrading to the interaction with a large cast of characters, displays a polish and attention to quality that you find only in real classics... DC2 could very well be the PlayStation 2's Zelda.",90

14938,82,475,8,"A bitch of a game to review. But for the same reasons it's a joy of a game to play. There's just so much to it. It's a town-builder, a compelling dungeon-crawler, a fishing game, a golf game and, in short, a great RPG.",90
14939,132,475,8,Most importantly—and this will make Dark Cloud fans very happy—Level-5 has fixed nearly everything wrong with the first game.,90

14946,395,475,8,"Sure, the game is infinitely more impressive when each piece is broken down, but with an experience that begs to be played ad infinitum, yet quickly screams to be over long before it finally ends, the whole experience can feel a little flat.",80

Controller in hand, it still is a great game to play, with a brilliant gameplay mashup and various neat ideas. This time though, id Software delivered ""only"" a great game, not a masterpiece.",80

15322,213,1208,17,"An easily accessible but surprisingly nuanced game. While there are some stumbling points here and there, such as the strange local multiplayer omissions in Table tennis or the muddled co-op mechanics of soccer, Kinect Sports still manages to be fun and different.",80
15323,110,1208,17,"In the end, if you're looking for a way to show off your new Kinect, this provides a great complement to the pack-in title, Kinect Adventures.",80
15324,260,1208,17,"A good party game, very funny to play with friends at home or over Xbox Live.",80
15325,146,1208,17,"There are moments of pure unadulterated joy packed into this sports compilation, and although it's all over rather rapidly, it's a great ride while it lasts.",80
15326,353,1208,17,Kinect Sports is a brilliant example of how good a mini-game compilation can be and proves to be an excellent demonstration of how well Kinect can work. It does lack a little depth in some areas but proves to be an excellent title to play with friends.,80
15327,408,1208,17,"Despite its ups and downs, and its limitations, Kinect Sports is a great game, with such an ability to turn something new, Kinect, into the center of many hours of fun and magic.",80
15328,249,1208,17,"It's cool, fun and full of sporting attitude which is incredibly hard not to fall in love with.",80
15329,430,1208,17,"Kinect Sports is fun, challenging and a great addition to your collection. This is another Kinect game you really should buy if you are planning to buy Kinect.",80
15330,233,1208,17,"Rare's work on Kinect Sports really demonstrates what the camera is capable when it's used by a capable developer. If you've already got the hardware to play it on, consider Kinect Sports a must-have.",80
15331,199,1208,17,"I'll go so far as to say that the genre of sports-themed minigame collections probably isn't capable of really being revolutionized, but Kinect Sports gets dangerously close, simply by virtue of doing the one thing other motion-controlling technologies haven't been able to yet: Tracking your feet.",80
15332,124,1208,17,"I can say that Kinect Sports is now my second favorite Kinect title, right behind Dance Central.",80
15333,438,1208,17,Something for everyone. [Jan 2011],80
15334,50,1208,17,Every bit as fun as it is unoriginal. And football's ace.,79
15335,41,1208,17,"There's just not enough to do in this game. If you're playing by yourself, you may only get a few hours of unique content out of this game. You'll want to replay them, but it will only last so long. Families should have a blast with this though.",78
15336,140,1208,17,"This motion-controlled sports collection doesn't do much for solo players, but it's fun to play with friends both locally and online.",75
15337,372,1208,17,Kinect Sports is a robust package that offers a lot of variety on one disc.,75
15338,289,1208,17,"The world won't be able to resist comparing Kinect Sports to Nintendo's Wii Sports gold standard, and the newcomer doesn't disappoint. Bowling and boxing are the two overlapping sports, and in the Kinect edition they're just as responsive and immediately accessible as you'd expect after four years of playing the Wii-mote version.",75
15339,4,1208,17,Kinect Sports is a fun and accessible sports game. This game does an admirable job as a launch tittle.,75
15340,1,1208,17,"Kinect Sports works well enough as a launch title and has more than enough heft to ensure that it's not labeled as just a tech demo. Yes, there are some kinks that need to be addressed, particularly with the hardware, but if you're looking to pad out the library for your shiny new peripheral, Kinect Sports should be a definite consideration.",75
15341,147,1208,17,"Wii Sports has got some competition breathing down its neck with Kinect Sports. While the game doesn't support much outside of two-player competition (and even that's questionable) and has its reading issues, it's a well-planned collection that you shouldn't hesitate to pick up with your Kinect device. Let's hit the lanes!",75
15342,82,1208,17,"But as a lively, funny, polished and varied genre title that will slap a smile on the face of the most jaded cynic, Kinect Sports does its job admirably.",70
15343,374,1208,17,"As party games go, Kinect Sports is infectiously good fun. It's highly doubtful that this title will be enough to woo Wii owners over to the Xbox 360 on ts own. But for players who already own Microsoft's console and a Kinect sensor, it's more than worth a look.",70
15344,413,1208,17,"The football is shoddy, avatars glitch out and every now and again and the responsiveness of the game is occasionally brought into question - but none of this stops the experience being enjoyable. To conclude then, the answer to a question that has been on everybody's lips: is Kinect Sports better than Wii Sports?... Without a doubt.",70
15345,186,1208,17,Overall Kinect Sports can be seen as a success and gives the peripheral a strong foundation. A must have default option for every Kinect owner it offers a great night in if you don't wish to venture outside.,70
15346,84,1208,17,"Kinect Sports in a good party game, and offers some great experiences like volley and ping pong. Just like any other multi-event game, it offers good and bad sports, but the final result is a nice and entertaining product.",70
15347,87,1208,17,"This should have been bundled with Kinect instead of Kinect Adventures: it's competitive, social and fun.",70
15348,415,1208,17,"Some mini games are really funny, others may be too simple. Soccer for example is only kicking with your feet. The players are moving automatically. Like all the casual stuff Kinect Sports will offer its complete potential at your party.",70
15349,268,1208,17,"And that's really about it. Like Wii Sports, you will probably have a lot of fun while the Kinect technology is still new and exciting, but after that wears off, you'll only bring this one out for parties or over-energetic kids.",70
15350,432,1208,17,"Kinect Sports as a launch title though is extremely promising and it does show that Kinect could very well have a future in every living room – big living rooms that is. As it stands now though, Kinect Sports is perfect for short bursts with friends and is certainly unique, but there are a few annoyances that regrettably hamper the whole experience.",70
15351,365,1208,17,"An entertaining product, a must have for every Kinect fan out there. Some minigames and sports are not well developed as other, and some polish is lacking, yet you'll have a lot of fun with it.",68
15352,89,1208,17,"Kinect Sports has some interesting activities, but some of the minigame are dull and laughable. Boxe and Table Tennis lacks precision, while Volleyball is the best activity included in the package.",65
15353,67,1208,17,"There's some fun to be had here, for certain; it's definitely a more well-rounded package than something like Wii Sports. But ultimately, there aren't enough fresh ideas here to vindicate it as the new king of motion-controlled sports mini games.",65
15354,151,1208,17,"While Kinect Sports falls flat in the single player experience the fun to be had with friends carries it. Occasional motion control issues and the space required can hinder some of the fun but overall, and in a market flooded with choice, Kinect Sports holds its ground and should bring some high energy entertainment to your living room.",65
15355,145,1208,17,"It would have made a nice pack-in, but package ends up feeling uninspired, relying on little more than the fast-fading novelty of motion controls.",64
15356,91,1208,17,"Kinect Sports showcases what Kinect can do in a sports setting. While its not a perfect package there is some fun to be had here in social gatherings. Some refinement is definitely needed, but hey, this is the first round. If a substitute Kinect version of Wii Sports sounds interesting then by all means pick up Kinect Sports.",62
15357,451,1208,17,"Lushly presented, and with enough of that trademark Rare wit to keep you smiling, it's inoffensive enough fare before the real games arrive, but it's going nowhere Nintendo's not been already.",60
15358,184,1208,17,"If you're not too keen on soccer or table tennis, then feel free to knock a few points off this score, since those are the main reasons to play the game.",60
15359,257,1208,17,"Just as shallow and unoriginal as you'd expect, and with some fairly obvious technical issues. But it still offers hope for the future of Kinect.",60
15360,148,1208,17,"Kinect Sports is a nice surprise among the launch line-up of Kinect. Granted, it's nothing outstanding, but still good fun. It's easy to pick-up, and family-friendly. And actually pretty physical! All we would ask is a new iteration with more mini-games, fun and ideas.",60
15361,86,1208,17,"Kinect Sports can bee lots of fun when played with other people, but there is a huge Déjà Vu, especially when compared to Wii Sports.",60
15362,115,1208,17,"Ultimately, Kinect Sports is a rough launch title that's all about the novelty of Kinect.",58
15363,171,1208,17,The football mini game is fun. The rest so-so. All of them suffer from Kinect's sluggish response.,50
15364,149,1208,17,"First of all destined to all the family and festive, Kinect Sports is a preview of the capabilities of Kinect, but it's not with this title that the Xbox 360 will widen the gap in the race for motion gaming.",50
